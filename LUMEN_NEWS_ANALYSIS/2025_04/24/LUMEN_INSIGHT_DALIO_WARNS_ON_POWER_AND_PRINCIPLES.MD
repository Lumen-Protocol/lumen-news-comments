# Title
LUMEN INSIGHT: DALIO WARNS ON POWER AND PRINCIPLES

# Summary
Ray Dalio's "Principle of the Day" emphasizes that the sustainability of governance systems hinges not on design but on the integrity of those in power. He critiques the current global governance crisis, where personal interests overshadow institutional principles, leading to systemic collapse. Dalio outlines a three-phase power structure: vision, execution, and corruption, highlighting how neglect of principles by leaders erodes institutional efficacy. He predicts a future where governance will focus on the conflict between principles and interest groups, with potential shifts towards strongman politics. Ultimately, he warns that the real danger lies in losing faith in governing principles.

# News Comment
1. Event Identification

Ray Dalio releases the "Principle of the Day" viewpoint:

"If those in power are unwilling to act according to principles, any principle-based system will fail." He succinctly points out that the sustainability of a system does not depend on its design but on the cognitive boundaries and self-restraint of those in power.

2. Motivation Analysis
- Responding to the current global governance trust crisis: Whether it's the independence of the Federal Reserve, the constitutional conflict in Israel, or China's structural logic of "the party is greater than the law," it reflects the tension between power and rules. Dalio's statement addresses the degeneration of global structural governance.
- Extending his worldview of "Principlesism": Dalio believes that truly sustainable organizations and nations must place systemic principles above individual or factional will.
- Warning against the political risks of personal worship and institutional stagnation: If those in power prioritize personal goals over institutional logic, institutional collapse is only a matter of time.

3. Structural Perspective

Dalio's three-phase power structure:
- Vision Phase: System designers aim to construct a fair and effective structure based on rational principles.
- Execution Phase: System operation relies on a group of "powerful yet principled" executors.
- Corruption Phase: When those in power gradually turn the "system" into a "tool" for personal gain, principles are eroded, and the system fails.

âœ¦ The root of structural failure: It is not the imperfection of the institution but the choice of those in power to disregard it.

4. Key Variables
- Whether those in power are willing to accept institutional constraints.
- Whether the institution has designed adequate feedback and accountability mechanisms for those in power.
- Whether there exists a collective cognitive community of "supra-personal will" (e.g., constitution, fundamental laws, supreme courts).
- Whether there is a peaceful and legal channel for power transition.

5. Trend Predictions
- Future political governance will no longer be a game of "institution vs individual," but a long-term struggle of "principle vs interest groups."
- Institutional fatigue will cause more governance systems to revert to "strongman politics" or "cultural fundamentalism" for short-term efficiency.
- Technology may become a new generation of "institutional agents" (e.g., AI + legal adjudication mechanisms), replacing inefficient and corrupt "human governance."
- Societal perception of "whether those in power follow the rules" will gradually surpass the importance of "election results" themselves.

ðŸ§© Structural Summary

Ray Dalio's statement is simple yet incisive, targeting the fundamental logical paradox of political structures:

When those in power transcend the rules, the rules become a performance rather than boundaries.

Without something "higher than power"â€”whether it be law, principles, or a consensus of the peopleâ€”all systems will ultimately degenerate into the "illusion of human governance."

Dalio's warning serves as a reminder to every national governor and institutional designer: 

The most dangerous moment is not the onset of power abuse but the end of faith in principles.
