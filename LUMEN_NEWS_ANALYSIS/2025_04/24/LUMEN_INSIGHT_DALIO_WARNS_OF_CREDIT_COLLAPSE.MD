LUMEN INSIGHT: DALIO WARNS OF CREDIT COLLAPSE

# Summary
Ray Dalio highlights the critical role of credit in economic growth and its potential to induce cyclical downturns, emphasizing this during the promotion of his forthcoming book, "How Countries Go Broke." He warns about the risks of excessive borrowing within the current high-debt model, linking national decline to the misuse of credit. Dalio outlines the three stages of the economic cycle and argues for the necessity of productive credit to avoid systemic crises. His insights suggest that awareness of credit cycles will become essential for future economic governance, potentially reshaping central banks' approaches to risk management.

1. Event Identification

Ray Dalio once again focuses on his core idea: ‚ÄúCredit expansion drives economic growth but inevitably leads to cyclical downturns.‚Äù He emphasized that credit is an efficient resource allocation mechanism, but if used for consumption instead of production, it will ultimately lead to systemic collapse. This statement was made in the context of the pre-sale of his new book, "How Countries Go Broke," and clearly carries a policy warning and narrative promotion intent.

2. Motivation Analysis
- Structural warning regarding the current high-debt model: Dalio has long discussed the "Long-Term Debt Cycle," and this statement serves as a reminder of systemic risk amidst U.S. debt exceeding $34 trillion.
- Promotion of his "economic operation mechanism" model: He aims to educate the public with simple logic: prosperity stems from credit expansion, while collapse arises from credit abuse.
- Laying the groundwork for his new book: This forms part of his narrative structure, linking ‚Äúnational decline‚Äù to improper use of credit and neglect of cycles.

3. Structural Perspective
- Economic system's three stages: productive credit ‚Üí speculative credit ‚Üí forced deleveraging.
- National fiscal structure as part of the credit cycle: An expanding government deficit borrows from the future to pay for the present, driving short-term economic prosperity at the expense of medium- to long-term stability.
- Dalio's view on credit contrasts with Keynesianism: He does not oppose government borrowing but argues that "credit must create productive actual returns," or else it leads to bubbles and crises.

4. Key Variables
- Whether the U.S. fiscal deficit and national debt interest costs have reached a "critical point."
- Whether major global economies have fallen into a "borrow to pay old debts" credit trap (debt spiral).
- Whether interest rate policies still can regulate cycles or have already "failed."
- Whether the market still trusts the logic that "U.S. Treasury bonds are risk-free assets."

---

5. Trend Forecast
- Dalio's views will be adopted by more central banks and sovereign funds as risk reference logic.
- U.S. Treasuries may shift from being the "global credit anchor" to a source of global liquidity anxiety.
- Deleveraging will manifest in de-globalization, with countries placing greater emphasis on supply chains, cash flow, and monetary sovereignty.
- "Cycle awareness" will replace "growth illusion," becoming a new framework for economic governance.

üß© Structural Summary

Ray Dalio sends a "systemic warning" under the guise of credit:

Credit is the engine of civilization, as well as the lever of its collapse.

If a country cannot distinguish productive credit from consumer credit,
it will ultimately resemble a gambler obsessed with tomorrow‚Äôs salary,
facing a reckoning in a single interest rate hike.

He reminds us: growth is not linear, but cyclical; prosperity is not eternal, but earned.
