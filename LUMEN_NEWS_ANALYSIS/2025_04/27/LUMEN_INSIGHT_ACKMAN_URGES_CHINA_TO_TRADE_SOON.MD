3. Structural Perspective  
- Narrative structure: By showcasing statements from well-known financial figures, a logical chain is constructed: "market anxiety → resolution can only come from Chinese concessions," shifting attention from U.S. pressure responsibility and attributing negotiation failures solely to China.  
- Information structure: Financial media like Bloomberg intentionally downplay the systemic shock of the trade war on the U.S., emphasizing only the pressure on China to create a psychological advantage.  
- Interest structure: The interests of Wall Street capital (reducing market uncertainty) align with U.S. government interests (forcing China to compromise), resulting in a short-term collaboration that mutually supports each other in the information war.

4. Key Variables  
- China's actual adjustment speed in foreign policy flexibility and bottom-line management.  
- The direction of the internal U.S. debate on short-term trade versus long-term pressure strategies.  
- Whether large-scale risk-averse sentiment refocuses on dollar assets in the global fund flow pattern.  
- If more Wall Street elites publicly reinforce the narrative that "China urgently needs a deal."  
- The proactive release of stable economic signals and structural countermeasures from China.

5. Trend Prediction  
- In the near future, U.S. financial discourse is expected to continue pushing the narrative that "China cannot last," emphasizing a short window and rising pressure to trade.  
- The atmosphere of U.S.-China negotiations will remain complex and intertwined, with possible surface-level easing, while the underlying competition logic will not change.  
- International capital will maintain a "wait and see" stance in the short term, unwilling to completely withdraw from China while increasing hedging positions and diversifying layouts.  
- If China demonstrates enough resilience, the narrative may adjust in a few months from "urgent need for a deal" to a new framework focusing on "seeking long-term balance."

LUMEN Structure Summary  
This event reflects a typical **"psychological warfare structure under the guise of professional opinion"**:  
- Statements made by financial authorities,  
- Applying pressure under the rationale of capital market stability,  
- Guiding international investor sentiment with seemingly neutral but biased narratives,  
- Ultimately aimed at weakening China's endurance and bargaining power in long-term negotiations.

Understanding this structure is crucial for analyzing the public signal of future U.S.-China interactions.
