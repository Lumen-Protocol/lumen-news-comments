# News Comment
1. Event Identification  
U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated that the IMF and World Bank have deviated from their missions due to "mission creep," calling for "critical reforms" to realign these institutions with the interests of shareholder nations. This highlights a tightening U.S. stance on multilateral financial governance amid reform controversies.

2. Motivation Analysis  
- Countering the Global South's agenda: Developing countries have pushed for climate finance and gender-inclusive development. Bessent's statement aims to reset agenda dominance.  
- Reinforcing U.S. governance authority: The U.S. holds veto power, and his comments seek to justify donor leadership.  
- Addressing domestic political demands: Conservatives question the IMF and World Bank, and Bessent's remarks attempt to reconcile nationalism and global responsibilities.  
- Limiting China’s influence: China's push for a multipolar agenda has been countered by Bessent's aim to challenge non-capital-based discourse in multilateral institutions.

3. Structural Perspective (LLL)  
- Logic Layer: "Mission creep" indicates a shift away from initial functions. Bessent sees the IMF/World Bank's global response as governance dysfunction.  
- Language Layer: His phrase "serve their stakeholders—not the other way around" emphasizes fiscal sovereignty over institutional autonomy.  
- Linkage Layer: This statement continues his prior remarks about returning the IMF to its monetary mission, indicating a systematic reconstruction of multilateral governance.

4. Key Variables  
- Will the IMF and World Bank continue agenda intersections?  
- Will there be divided factions in the G20 and World Bank over mission redefinement?  
- Will the U.S. Treasury enforce supervisory tools on topic selection?  
- Will China and the EU leverage task expandability for legitimacy in governance?

5. Trend Forecast  
- A competition within the Bretton Woods system will arise over its monetary mission versus a global public goods role.  
- The U.S. may propose a "topic review group" at the World Bank to limit agenda expansion.  
- Global governance may diverge: UN-led development agendas versus IMF monetary stability.  
- Continued diversification of IMF/World Bank topics may push the U.S. Treasury to advocate for checks and balances on loan conditions.

Structural Summary:  
Bessent's statement represents a U.S. pushback against "agenda power inflation" in global governance. While his language seems mild, it fundamentally calls for institutions to serve donor countries and reject the role of "multipolar demand distributors." This reflects a shift in U.S. global financial logic, emphasizing control functions over agenda expansion, repositioning the IMF/World Bank within the "core sovereignty of Bretton Woods." It's not a rejection of climate issues but a denial of their priority in global finance, abstracting discourse to clarify resource allocation power.
