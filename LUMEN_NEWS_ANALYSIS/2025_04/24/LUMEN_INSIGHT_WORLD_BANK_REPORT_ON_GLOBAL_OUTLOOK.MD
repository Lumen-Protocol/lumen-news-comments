1. Event Identification  
The World Bank's Global Regional Economic Outlook report for early 2025 addresses various regions, providing macro data to inform strategic planning for international capital and governments. This data presents a "map update for global order."

2. Motivation Analysis  
- World Bank's goals: 1) To maintain its status as a "global intermediary" during deglobalization; 2) To shape global narratives amid G7 disorder and IMF credibility issues.
- Global South countries aim to: 1) Use data to enhance investment appeal; 2) Seek support for financing and debt reduction; 3) Gain bargaining power through regional integration.
- Investment sector motivations include: Positioning for regional growth amidst U.S.-China competition and focusing on "alternative growth blocks."

3. Structural Perspectives  
- Global growth patterns are shifting from the US and China to multiple centers, with countries like India and Vietnam emerging.
- Developing countries face high dollar interest rates and currency depreciation, causing inflation.
- Many regions, particularly sub-Saharan Africa, face critical sovereign debt challenges.
- Central Asian countries are realigning their economic dependencies, while Latin America is leveraging U.S. reindustrialization for green manufacturing.

4. Key Variables  
- Changes in interest rates in developed countries will impact capital flows in emerging markets.  
- China's transition to a focus on domestic demand and localization could have varying spillover effects.  
- De-risking from China influences comparative advantages in emerging markets.  
- Extreme weather will impact agriculture, energy, and governance challenges.  
- Ongoing geopolitical conflicts will affect global energy stability.

5. Trend Forecast  
- Short-term (2025-2026): Southeast Asia, South Asia, and Latin America will attract structural foreign investment; Africa will struggle to transform.
- Mid-term (2027-2032): A mix of "structural disinflation + impoverishment" will emerge, with some countries advancing rapidly while others remain in debt.
- Long-term (post-2032): The world economy will increasingly depend on institutional quality over resources, revealing "regional growth poles" and "institutional black holes."

Structural Summary  
The regional economic update reports serve as a visual interface for global order evolution. The World Bank aims to redefine the "growth story map," where control over structural expectations influences capital flow and future governance.

The focus should be on whether countries can translate growth structures into governance capabilities, as mere improvements in rankings will not alleviate suffering.
