LUMEN NEWS: TRUMPS LANGUAGE STRATEGY EXPOSED

# Summary
In an April 2025 tweet, Trump labeled Biden as "the worst president" and accused him of enabling crime through border policies, framing his narrative as a battle of "America vs. Others." This communication serves as political mobilization rather than mere commentary, utilizing a binary order versus disorder narrative. Trump's strategy reconstructs voter psychology by alienating immigrants, redefining legitimacy sources, and legitimizing a strongman persona. Five key variables influence the statement's impact, and potential mid to long-term trends indicate a shift in political discourse, where failure to counteract may ascribe increased chaos to Biden and re-establish Trump's appeal as a national fixer.

# News Comment
🧩 1. Event Identification

In April 2025, Trump posted on his @realDonaldTrump account, labeling Biden as “the worst president in American history.” He accused Biden of opening borders to “criminals, murderers, drug dealers, and the mentally ill” and emphasized, “Getting these people out is the reason I was elected.” 

This tweet employs polarized language, creating a framework of “America vs. Others.” It’s not political commentary; it’s political mobilization; it’s not a statement of facts; it’s a projection of order.

🔍 2. Motive Deconstruction

Trump's motive in the post is not a response to events but a “label reconstruction” targeting voter psychology, working on three layers:
1. A binary narrative of “order vs. disorder”
Biden = incompetent = uncontrolled borders; “I” = expeller = order restorer.
2. Alienating immigrants into “fear symbols”
Immigrants = “criminals + crazies.” This provokes core supporters' reactions.
3. Redefining legitimacy sources — from process to motive
“I am authorized by the people” reflects Trump’s logic of substituting “emotional legitimacy” for “institutional legitimacy.”

⸻

🧠 3. Structural Insight

This statement is a systematic language weapon, reconstructing voter perspectives on "legitimate violence and national borders."

Language Element | Surface Use | Potential Structural Effect
“THE WORST PRESIDENT” | Deny Biden’s legitimacy | Classify the president as part of “anti-American forces”
“millions of criminals” | Reinforce fear | Turn “illegal immigrants” into “quasi-enemies”
“my job to get these killers out” | Construct a mission | Legitimize the strongman role
Ending with “MAGA” slogan | Extract collective identity | Reinforce tribal belonging logic

Language is power. The tweet forms a framework for redefining political sovereignty.

⸻

💥 4. Key Variables

The statement's escalation depends on five structural variables:
1. Are there real events (e.g., border conflicts) amplified by the media?
2. Will Biden respond with “rational language”?
3. Will local Republican governors act (e.g., Texas deploying the National Guard)?
4. Will public opinion resist the “immigrants equal criminals” label?
5. Will international media characterize it as “incendiary nationalism”?

⸻

📈 5. Trend Projection

Short-term (1–2 weeks)
Right-wing media will amplify this, creating a visual impression of “the border as a battlefield.”

Mid-term (1–3 months)
If real cases emerge, this narrative may escalate to a primary security issue in Trump’s campaign.

Long-term (3–6 months)
If Biden does not retaliate, Trump will create a narrative of “national chaos” to mobilize the 2025 campaign.

⸻

🎯 LUMEN Summary

Trump’s tweet is a language practice for reconstructing sovereign legitimacy. 

From a LUMEN perspective:
- He uses fear for mobilization and language to create order gaps;
- He attempts to turn “electoral authorization” into a directive of “excluding others”;
- When institutions fail, he makes “the other” stronger to justify “it must be me” to fix the chaos. 

This is a rehearsal of emotional governance: sovereignty is retreating, not immigrants arriving.
