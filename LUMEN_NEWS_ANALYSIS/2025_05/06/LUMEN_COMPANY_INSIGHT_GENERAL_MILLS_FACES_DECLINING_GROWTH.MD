1. Event Identification  
General Mills (NYSE: GIS) has seen a decline in growth momentum in recent years, with core operating metrics as follows:  
	• Unit sales: down for two consecutive years, reflecting weak demand  
	• Organic revenue growth: below industry benchmarks for the past two years  
	• Sales expectations for the next 12 months: down 4.3%

2. Motivational Analysis  
The main issue facing General Mills is not cost or profit pressure, but "declining consumer loyalty." While its core brand portfolio (like breakfast cereals) is strong, it has not effectively responded to emerging consumer trends (high-protein, plant-based, convenient options). Management has taken a conservative approach to products and channels, focusing on maintaining profit margins and dividends, showing no willingness for transformation or acquisition ambitions.  

3. Structural Perspective  
General Mills' operational structure reflects a typical "mature brand defense model": high cash flow supports solid dividends, but there is a lack of growth drivers in revenue. The product portfolio is highly concentrated, heavily reliant on single categories, with slow innovation in channels (especially e-commerce and direct sales). Additionally, its organizational structure relies on linear expansion without a mechanism for creating breakout products, leading to a growth structure of "slow decline + profit preservation."

4. Key Variables  
	• Organic growth recovery: a key indicator for assessing the effectiveness of brand innovation  
	• Investment in channel digitization (DTC, delivery): will determine the difficulty of its growth path transformation  
	• Raw material price trends (grains, sugar, etc.): affect the ability to pass costs and pricing strategies  
	• Emerging brand invasion (e.g., health snack startups): directly threatens its core market share  

5. Trend Forecast  
If General Mills does not implement strategic product innovation or acquisitions, its revenue is likely to continue to decline slowly. Cash flow will continue to support dividends and buybacks, but the gradual loss of market share may lead to a revaluation of its valuation system. In the short term, it may have defensive positioning value, but from a structural growth perspective, it is on a passive decline trajectory.  

LUMEN Structure Summary  
General Mills is a classic example of a “cash-stable but structurally aging” food company. Under the LUMEN perspective, its current system is a “value-closed structure”: weak endogenous innovation, strong path dependency, and slow response to external changes in its organizational structure. Its long-term survival will depend on two variables: the tolerance of capital markets and the ability to achieve structural reconfiguration through external acquisitions. Without substantial breakthroughs, it will exist only as a “low-growth, strong dividend, slow decline” cash flow equilibrium.
