2. Motivation Analysis  
• Warren's motivation: To continue her longstanding stance on strengthening financial regulation, using public pressure to build her image as a "defender of financial regulation" and mobilize dissatisfaction against Wall Street.  
• Bessent's motivation: As a heavyweight in the financial industry, she may have expressed criticisms or dissatisfaction with the current regulatory environment, economic policies, or political dynamics, reflecting internal industry anxieties about policy direction.  
• Media motivation: By amplifying the conflict between politics and business, they create public interest while hinting at potential tensions between the financial sector and Washington, increasing topic sensitivity.

3. Structural Perspective  
• Tension in the political-business interaction structure: Given the macro environment of high interest rates, de-globalization, and strengthened regulation, traditional mechanisms for coordinating interests between Wall Street and Washington are under strain, showing more signs of public conflict.  
• Reshaping public opinion structure: Leftist forces within the Democratic Party, represented by Warren, are making "anti-Wall Street elite" a core narrative for reshaping voter mobilization.  
• Active latent game structure: Private statements leaking into the public domain reflect increasing pressures for transparency, and internal disagreements becoming public opinion events, forcing political and capital elites to adjust their strategies.

4. Key Variables  
• Specific details of Bessent's remarks and the leakage methods;  
• Whether Warren and her allies will push for hearings, investigations, or legislative proposals;  
• The financial industry's genuine response and collective strategy towards current or proposed regulatory policies;  
• Changes in the weight of financial regulation topics within the Democratic Party for the 2025 elections;  
• The degree of event escalation and public opinion direction by mainstream and social media.

5. Trend Prediction  
• Warren and allied legislators may seize this opportunity to intensify public criticism of the financial industry and push for stricter disclosure and moral hazard restrictions.  
• Financial executives will further tighten risk management regarding their public and private remarks to avoid unintentionally sparking political storms.  
• A new round of legislative initiatives around "financial system transparency and accountability," especially focused on large banks, hedge funds, and wealth management firms, may emerge.  
• In the medium to long term, the "public cooperation, private resistance" model between Wall Street and Washington may be further disrupted, leading to more public confrontation or strategic concessions.

LUMEN Structure Summary  
Warren's questioning of Bessent is not just an isolated political pressure action but a reflection of the accelerated changes in the financial power structure for 2025. Essentially,  
• It is a microcosmic representation of the reallocation of political power against capital power.  
• It represents the erosion of traditional political-business consensus by new public opinion mechanisms.  
• It is yet another prelude to the internal institutional tensions exposed in the U.S. amid the global trend of de-financialization.  
In the future, the American financial industry will have to reshape its legitimacy and survival logic under conditions of higher transparency and stronger political intervention. Warren's representation is not a random political move but a structural and long-term institutional pressure trend.
