LUMEN INSIGHT: TRUMP ADMINISTRATION TAX CUT PLANS 2025

# Summary
In 2025, following President Trump's re-election, Congressional Republicans are advancing the "One Big, Beautiful Bill," which aims to permanently extend individual income tax cuts from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act while introducing new tax exemptions. The bill seeks to bolster economic growth, alleviate middle-class tax burdens, and demonstrate political commitment ahead of the 2026 midterms. However, it raises structural concerns over heightened federal deficits, tax fairness, and administrative feasibility. The success of this legislation hinges on internal party coordination, fiscal sustainability, and public support, with potential short-term economic stimulation overshadowed by long-term fiscal risks.

1. Event Identification  
In 2025, after President Trump is re-elected, Congressional Republicans are accelerating a legislative plan called "One Big, Beautiful Bill," aimed at permanently extending the individual income tax cuts from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) and introducing new tax cuts, such as exemptions for tips, overtime pay, and Social Security income. The bill also addresses significant issues like border security, energy policy, and trade, intending to pass through budget reconciliation in Congress to avoid Democratic obstruction.

2. Motivation Analysis  
The main motivations for the Trump administration to promote this bill include:  
- Consolidating the "America First" economic agenda: by extending and expanding tax cuts to stimulate domestic consumption and investment, promoting economic growth.  
- Responding to middle-class tax burden pressures: preventing an increase in individual income tax rates after the tax cuts expire at the end of 2025, which would increase the tax burden on the middle class.  
- Political mobilization and election considerations: demonstrating the Republican commitment to tax cuts and economic policy to voters ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.

3. Structural Insights  
The advancement of this bill reveals the following structural issues in U.S. federal finance and tax policy:  
- The contradiction between deficits and tax cuts: according to the Congressional Budget Office, continuing the 2017 tax cut policy is estimated to increase the federal deficit by about $4.6 trillion over the next decade.  
- Controversy over tax fairness: analysis from the Treasury shows that if tax cuts are fully extended, the wealthiest 0.1% would receive an average annual tax cut of $314,000, capturing most of the tax cut benefits.  
- Challenges in administrative execution: given the high fiscal deficit, effectively implementing tax cuts while maintaining government operations and public services poses a significant test of administrative capability.

4. Key Variables  
- Internal coordination in Congress: there are discrepancies within the Republican Party in both chambers regarding the scale of tax cuts and spending reductions, requiring internal coordination to reach consensus.  
- Fiscal sustainability: how to fund tax cuts without further exacerbating the deficit is key to the policy's sustainability.  
- Public opinion and voter reaction: the distribution of tax benefits will affect public support for government economic policies, thereby influencing election outcomes.

5. Trend Forecast  
In the short term, the Trump administration and Congressional Republicans will continue pushing for the billâ€™s passage, aiming to complete the legislation by summer 2025. In the mid-term, if the tax cuts are implemented, they may stimulate economic growth in the short run but could exacerbate fiscal deficits in the long term, limiting government spending in other areas. In the long run, failure to effectively address fiscal sustainability may lead to market concerns over the U.S. financial situation, impacting economic stability.

Structural Summary  
The "One Big, Beautiful Bill" promoted by the Trump administration seeks to reshape the U.S. economic structure and fiscal policy through large-scale tax cuts. However, amid high fiscal deficits, controversies over tax fairness, and limitations in administrative capacity, the implementation of this policy faces numerous challenges. If these structural issues are not effectively addressed, the tax cut policy might struggle to achieve its expected goals and could even trigger new economic and fiscal risks.
