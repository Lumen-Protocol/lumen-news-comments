💼 1. Event Recognition  
After Trump’s re-election and return to the White House, market attention swiftly shifted to the fate of Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell. Yahoo Finance pointedly asked whether Trump has the power to “fire Powell,” turning Wall Street and Washington into a new battleground.

🧠 2. Motivation Analysis  
Trump has long criticized Powell for being “too independent” in monetary policy, raising interest rates, suppressing the stock market, and harming employment and manufacturing, presenting a systematic resistance to his economic agenda. With the Federal Reserve facing pressures of “high inflation + high interest rates + default risks,” persisting with a tightening path would directly counter Trump’s attempt to restart a growth cycle. Thus, “personnel is policy” becomes the starting point of the new administration’s power struggle.

⚖️ 3. Structural Perspective

Dimension | Legal Facts | Political Reality  
---|---|---  
Term Protection | The Fed chairman has a statutory 4-year term | The president has no direct firing power but can pressure resignation  
Impeachment Path | Congress must prove “serious misconduct or illegal behavior” | There are few precedents, and it's costly  
Function Adjustment | The president can adjust vice chair and board seats to create a "surrounding" situation | Establishing an internal voting alliance or policy stalemate  
Public Opinion Operation | Can continuously release narratives of “the Fed causing recession” | Forcing Powell to either relinquish power or soften his stance on interest rates  

📉 4. Key Variables  
• Will the Republican Party control the Senate Finance Committee to restructure oversight of the Fed?  
• Will Powell indicate a willingness to “cooperate” or step back for political face-saving?  
• Will Wall Street shift to the presidential camp demanding monetary easing for market stability?  
• Will foreign capital adjust its portfolio due to monetary policy uncertainty, creating financial pressure to “force a hand”?  

📈 5. Trend Forecast  
• Whether the Fed chairman “stays or goes” will become a core financial and political narrative in Q2 2025, directly influencing interest rate expectations, dollar strength, and global capital flows.  
• If Trump cannot quickly replace Powell, his team will prioritize pressuring Congress to reform the Fed's charter, expanding executive intervention rights.  
• The market will enter a “dual policy game” phase: economic expectations looking to the White House and monetary expectations focused on Powell.  
• If Powell maintains an anti-inflation stance until year-end, US stocks may face a “systemic conflict triggering a second shock.”  

🧭 Structural Summary  
Powell is not the problem; independence is the problem.  
Trump's target is not an individual official but a system.  
The topic of “firing Powell” signals not a legal maneuver but institutional reckoning.  
This is a renewed clash between the Fed and public opinion,  
and a deadly confrontation between monetary sovereignty and electoral legitimacy.
