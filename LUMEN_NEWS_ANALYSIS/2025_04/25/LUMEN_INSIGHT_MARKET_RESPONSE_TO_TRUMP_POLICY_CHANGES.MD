# Summary
On April 25, 2025, MarketWatch reported a rapid exit of the S&P 500 from "correction territory," attributed to President Trump's recent policy adjustments that eased market tensions. This analysis reveals a strategic retreat aimed at validating governance through market performance and negotiating leverage. The rebound is driven by a shift in macroeconomic sentiment rather than fundamental improvements, leading to quick capital inflows.

# News Comment
1. Event Identification

On April 25, 2025, MarketWatch reported that the S&P 500 index has recently moved quickly out of "correction territory," mainly due to President Trump's recent "walk-backs" on his previously aggressive stances—such as imposing tariffs and ongoing confrontations with the Federal Reserve. This action stabilized market expectations and encouraged swift capital inflows into risk assets.

2. Motivation Analysis

The Trump administration's "strategic retreat" is not accidental and can be analyzed from three dimensions:
- Market repair as a governance validation mechanism: The Trump administration closely monitors market performance as a real-time indicator of its governing legitimacy. After entering correction territory, the "reverse operation" aims to restore emotional boundaries.
- Strategic pressure followed by phased profit-taking: Previous high-pressure rhetoric (trade war, attacking the Fed) was appropriately "retracted" after achieving short-term negotiation leverage; this is typical "negotiation-style game theory,” resembling the tariff-cancel-rethreat cycle.
- Creating space for the next policy upgrade: Current easing releases market space, preparing for future impactful maneuvers.

3. Structural Perspective

This round of market rebound is not due to fundamental improvements but a structural reversal triggered by policy adjustments:
- The core variable is not corporate earnings, but "macroeconomic tone shift": Trump has refrained from public criticism of the Fed over the past two weeks and signaled the possibility of negotiations regarding tariffs, leading algorithm models to lower systemic risk pricing.
- Market structure remains fragile, but liquidity sentiment has quickly restored: Funds, initially on the risk-averse side (cash, treasuries, gold), have swiftly flowed back, reflecting a short-term judgment on "policy controllable boundaries," not confidence in economic recovery.
- Political discourse has become a directional variable for the market: Trump’s stance shift is viewed as a "bottom signal," indicating that the logic of the U.S. capital market has partially detached from fundamentals, shifting to "discourse strength linkage logic."

4. Key Variables
- Will Trump resume pressure on the Fed or Treasury, causing fluctuations?
- Is there any substantial progress in U.S.-China trade negotiations, or is it merely emotional control rhetoric?
- Will the Fed again be forced to respond due to "cooling remarks," exposing institutional tensions?
- Can tech and consumer sectors maintain upward momentum, or will they fall into a structural "bounce and sell" pattern?

5. Trend Prediction

This market rebound indicates that policy structure discourse has become the primary trigger for the capital market, with the S&P 500's technical trends starting to display characteristics of a "non-economic reversal." Future trends may include:
- Emergence of discourse/policy swing trading structures, with algorithmic funds modeling around the rhythm of presidential speeches.
- The Fed will be passively drawn into "policy cooperative performances," facing challenges in demonstrating independence amid political pressure and neutral data.
- Index volatility may show characteristics of "directional super-speed—structural hypoxia," characterized by rapid upward movement lacking substantial transaction support, leading to hollow market conditions.

This is not a technical rebound, but a stress test of institutional pressure under a discourse structure hedge. Trump hasn’t claimed "I made the market go up," but the market has "acknowledged” it.
