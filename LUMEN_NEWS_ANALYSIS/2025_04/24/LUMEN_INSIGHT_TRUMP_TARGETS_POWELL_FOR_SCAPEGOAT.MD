# Title
LUMEN INSIGHT: TRUMP TARGETS POWELL FOR SCAPEGOAT

# Summary
President Trump's recent statement withdrawing threats to fire Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell reflects a complex interplay of political strategy and economic challenges. With high interest rates contributing to market turmoil, Trump seeks scapegoats to blame for economic slowdown. Powell faces increased political pressure while navigating the delicate balance between inflation control and growth stimulation. The Fed's independence is vulnerable as Trump's tactics revive past pressures. Immediate implications suggest Powell will maintain his position, albeit with constrained policy flexibility, while long-term discussions may emerge regarding the Fed's governance. The situation exemplifies the tension between political and monetary independence amidst economic uncertainty.

# News Comment
1. Event Identification

After a week of openly threatening to fire Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, President Trump announced he "has no intention" of replacing him, but The Economist points out that the Fed remains one of his main targets for scapegoats, and political risks are not eliminated.

2. Motivation Analysis
   â€¢ Trumpâ€™s camp: Looking for scapegoats for the market turmoil and economic slowdown caused by high interest rates. The Fedâ€™s independence and technical nature are often portrayed as symbols of being "out of touch with the people's will," making it a suitable target for public criticism.
   â€¢ Powell himself: Facing a monetary policy dilemmaâ€”inflation remains unstable, room for interest rate cuts is limited, and political attacks are intensifying. Any hesitance in policy could be interpreted as "political surrender" or "delayed response."
   â€¢ Overall Republican Party: Amid divisions in policy (inflation reduction vs. growth preservation) and public anxiety, may tacitly approve or support pressure on Powell to stabilize voter sentiment.

3. Structural Perspective
   â€¢ Reappearance of the political vs. monetary independence game: Trump has previously attempted to pressure Powell during his first term and is returning to this familiar strategy.
   â€¢ Intensification of macro policy dilemmas: A combination of expansionary fiscal policy and tightening monetary policy is wavering, with the White House leaning towards "economic stimulation" rather than "inflation discipline."
   â€¢ Increasing vulnerability of the Fedâ€™s position: Losing the presidentâ€™s trust could undermine market belief in "Fed independence," triggering fluctuations in dollar interest rates and asset prices.

4. Key Variables
   â€¢ Whether CPI and PCE trends worsen in the next 3 months
   â€¢ Whether Trump restates his commitment to "intervening in the Fed" during campaigning
   â€¢ Whether the Republican Party signals alternative candidates
   â€¢ Whether any fractures in internal Fed voting attitudes emerge
   â€¢ Whether the White House initiates cross-paths of fiscal intervention and monetary policy

5. Trend Prediction
   â€¢ Short-term (1-2 months): Powell will not be immediately replaced, but his policy flexibility will be noticeably constrained, moving more towards "political hedging."
   â€¢ Medium-term (post-Q3 2025): If Trump strengthens pressure for economic growth, the Fed may be forced to cut rates earlier, even at the cost of some inflation targets.
   â€¢ Long-term (from 2026): The Fed's governance mechanism may face reevaluation, with the debate over whether to retain "non-elected independent power" becoming a focal point of systemic controversy.

ðŸ§© Structural Summary

For Trump to win, the economy must rise. 
But with high interest rates and a cool market, voter dissatisfaction necessitates accountability.

As long as Powell stays, the threats continue. 
Itâ€™s not about the Fed being wrong, 
but rather the president needing a "wrong person."

He doesn't truly want to fire the Fed, 
he just wants the market to know: 
This isnâ€™t my faultâ€” 
Itâ€™s Powellâ€™s refusal to cut rates.

This is an old trick of politicians: 
When the target is out of control, 
first control the person explaining the target.
