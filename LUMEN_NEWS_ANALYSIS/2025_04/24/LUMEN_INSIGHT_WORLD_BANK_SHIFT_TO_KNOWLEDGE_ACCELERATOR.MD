1. Event Identification  
The World Bank announced in Spring Meetings 2025 its shift from a "fund provider" to a "knowledge accelerator," focusing on empowering the next generation through employment, innovation, and entrepreneurship.

2. Motivation Analysis  
- World Bank's Motives: 1) Gain legitimacy in global financial resources competition; 2) Adapt to changing times as a "development partner"; 3) Address demands for "structural self-development" in the Global South.  
- Global Youth Motivation: Demand for recognized knowledge, capital, and entrepreneurial support amid changing employment structures and AI technology.  
- Government Motivation: Attain "structural reform label" and collaborate with the World Bank to showcase reform readiness to foreign capital.

3. Structural Perspective  
- Development Model Change: Transitioning to a "human capital priority + entrepreneurial innovation engine" structure, leveraging talent for economic self-reproduction.  
- Integration Model: Moving from loans to "knowledge-capital-platform" ecosystemic interventions.  
- Public Sector Role Shift: Change from borrower to incubator, with the World Bank acting as a think tank and seed investor.  
- Evaluation Mechanism Change: Focusing on "social impact + systemic regeneration capacity" over "project delivery."

4. Key Variables  
- National Governance Capability: Ability of education, employment, and entrepreneurship policies to synergize effectively.  
- Youth Demographics: Transforming the "youth dividend" in regions into productive populations.  
- Digital Access: Connectivity's role in entrepreneurship and knowledge acquisition.  
- Global Investment Preferences: Willingness of international capital to invest in youth innovation ecosystem.

5. Trend Prediction  
- Short-term (2025–2027): Promote pilot projects integrating "education-employment-entrepreneurship" in select cities.  
- Medium-term (2027–2032): Adopt "multilateral incubation model" with private platforms as standard.  
- Long-term (post-2032): Redefine development models based on fostering local knowledge cycles and youth innovation systems.

Structural Summary  
This signifies the World Bank's redefinition of development, moving from "borrowing to build" to "empowering youth." 

Key shifts include changing focuses from:  
- Inter-country financing to individual incentives,  
- Physical infrastructure to knowledge infrastructure,  
- Governance output to embedded growth mechanisms.  

The essence of these changes is not a lack of resources in developing countries but rather structural self-reproductive capacity. The World Bank's new challenge questions the traditional development framework and the authority in defining development. Future discourse will focus on power dynamics in incentive structure design.
