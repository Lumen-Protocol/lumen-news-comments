LUMEN Structural Analysis

The on-chain performance of the gork project shows strong capital concentration, with some high-level buyers already taking profits. solsmart58’s large holdings are a key variable for short-term prices, and its sell-off will pose significant correction pressure. Monitoring on-chain fund movements, especially from solsmart58 and solsmart71, is advised.
