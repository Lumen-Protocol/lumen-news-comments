LUMEN INSIGHT: US CHINA TRADE TALKS INCLUDE TAIWAN

# Summary
The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs has been notably reserved in sharing information, indicating that future trade discussions with the United States are likely to incorporate the "Taiwan issue" as a central theme. This suggests a shift in the parameters of economic negotiations between the two nations, potentially intertwining trade matters with geopolitical concerns regarding Taiwan. The implications of this move highlight the complexity of U.S.-China relations, where trade and political issues are increasingly interconnected.

# News Comment
At the same time, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs and think tank channels have rarely released information: any future trade dialogue between China and the U.S. may include the "Taiwan issue" as one of the core topics within the framework of economic negotiations.
