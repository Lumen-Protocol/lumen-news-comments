LUMEN INSIGHT: TRUMP POLICY PIVOTS BOOST MARKET SENTIMENT

# Summary
On April 25, 2025, MarketWatch highlighted that the S&P 500 exited correction territory due to President Trump's strategic pivots in his approach to the Federal Reserve and tariffs on China. These shifts aimed to alleviate market concerns and enhance sentiment. Analyzing the motivations reveals a structured adjustment to avoid market detachment while signaling controlled confrontation for negotiation leverage. The rebound reflects a temporary respite rather than a fundamental recovery, with key uncertainties regarding Trump's future behavior, US-China relations, and the Fed's stance. Overall, market resilience stems from hope rather than true confidence in economic prospects.

# News Comment
1. Event Identification

On April 25, 2025, MarketWatch reported that the recent quick exit of the S&P 500 from "correction territory" was primarily due to President Trump's strategic pivots in two areas:
   • First, he softened his attacks on the Federal Reserve.
   • Second, he moderated his stance on tariffs against China.
These changes alleviated systemic concerns in the market regarding “uncontrolled policy confrontation,” triggering a return of funds and a rebound in sentiment.

2. Motivational Analysis 

The political and economic motives behind these two “pivots” represent an organized adjustment in policy rhythm, with the structural logic including:
   • Avoiding a full detachment of the capital markets: The S&P was previously in a technical correction phase (down over 10%), and further deterioration would directly impact public confidence in economic management and election stability.
   • Sending a signal of “controlled confrontation”: The Trump administration creates pressure through a tough stance, then timely softens it to create an impression of “control,” achieving dual objectives in negotiations and voter engagement.
   • Reserving space for subsequent policy tools (such as fiscal stimulus or new AI policies): By first easing tensions and then transitioning smoothly, it maximizes political gains when implementing “market rescue” plans.

3. Structural Perspective 

This market rebound is essentially a “discursive institutional intervention”:
   • “Policy adjustment” replaces “fundamental recovery”: Corporate earnings have not fully rebounded, but a shift in the president's tone leads algorithms and quantitative models to reprice risk exposure;
   • The Federal Reserve and China become “emotional pricing anchors”: The boundaries of monetary policy independence and the direction of US-China negotiations become dominant non-economic variables;
   • Emotional repair ≠ trust restoration: The current rebound is a response from the market to the “potential easing of damage,” not a structural confidence in “improving economic pathways.”

4. Key Variables 
   • Whether Trump will reverse his stance again, restart attacks on the Federal Reserve, or escalate trade rhetoric, causing a new wave of volatility;
   • Whether the US and China will reach an informal technical relaxation agreement to provide companies with operable import routes;
   • Whether the Fed will passively support “policy neutrality” or fall victim to expected shifts under political manipulation;
   • Whether the upcoming earnings season will validate the reasonableness of current valuations or expose issues of “emotional overvaluation and fundamental mismatch.”

5. Trend Prediction 

The current rebound is not based on corporate earnings or economic expansion but on a temporary structural respite due to “softening policy confrontation.” The trend may develop as follows:
   • Indices may rise but remain structurally weak, with core sectors recovering but trading volume uneven and increasing capital concentration;
   • The market's dependence on Trump’s comments will continue to grow, making his rhetoric a short-term barometer for asset allocation;
   • The Fed's neutrality will face more complex public opinion entanglements, caught in a policy dilemma of “being wrong whether it follows political rhythm or not”;
   • US-China relations will once again become an “emotional anchor” rather than a logical game, with the market focused on tone rather than agreement specifics.

In short, the recovery of the S&P 500 does not indicate “market confidence in the future,” but rather “market hope that the future won’t be worse.” Trump's two pivots bought time for the market, not space.
