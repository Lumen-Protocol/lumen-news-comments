3. Structural Perspective

From the LUMEN structural analysis perspective:
• High capital concentration: solsmart58's position dominates and could significantly impact the market if sold.
• Short-term profit-taking: solsmart73’s quick sale reflects sensitivity to market instability, highlighting a short-term mentality.
• Potential correction risk: Some positions remain untouched, but the overall declining trend and short-term capital withdrawal suggest further downward pressure may exist.

4. Key Variables
• solsmart58's position handling: If liquidated, it will directly affect liquidity and market price.
• solsmart71's trading actions: Gradual sales may increase selling pressure.
• Liquidity changes: A decrease in liquidity pool depth may heighten market pressure risks.

5. Trend Forecast
1. Short-term high volatility: Major positions remain unreleased, but the market shows clear downward pressure, likely escalating volatility in the short term.
2. High sell-off risk: If solsmart58 opts to reduce or liquidate, market prices could plummet significantly.
3. Need to monitor inflows: Without new large buy orders, the existing position pressure will struggle to support price rebounds.

LUMEN Structural Analysis

The gork project’s on-chain performance shows a strong capital concentration, with some high-level buyers already realizing profits. solsmart58’s large holdings are a key variable for short-term pricing, and its potential selling could subject the market to substantial correction pressure. It is advised to monitor on-chain capital movements, especially concerning solsmart58 and solsmart71's subsequent actions.
