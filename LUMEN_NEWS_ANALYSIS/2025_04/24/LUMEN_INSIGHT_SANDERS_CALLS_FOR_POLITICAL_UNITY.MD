LUMEN INSIGHT: SANDERS CALLS FOR POLITICAL UNITY

# Summary
On April 23, 2025, Bernie Sanders posted a unifying message on X, urging an end to the political division between "red states and blue states," advocating for a government representative of the people amid rising class divides in U.S. politics. His video aims to reframe public sentiment, recalibrating the focus from geographical partisanship to economic class issues, potentially positioning him as a successor to Biden if he does not run. By employing a "de-billionaire governance" approach and avoiding direct opposition to Trump, Sanders seeks to activate a broader narrative centered on unity and class interests to reshape the political landscape ahead of the 2026 midterms.

1. Event Identification  
On April 23, 2025, Bernie Sanders posted a video on X, calling for an end to the narrative of political division between "red states/blue states," emphasizing "we are one people" and advocating for a government "of the people, by the people." The post gained significant interaction amidst increasing class divisions in U.S. politics, seen as a declaration ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.

2. Motivation Analysis  
Sanders' intentions include:

- Re-unifying public opinion divided by partisanship, shifting focus from geographical to class divides.
- Continuing his push for a "de-billionaire governance" framework, assuming Biden will not run.
- Quickly connecting with grassroots voters to reconstruct public opinion amid Trumpâ€™s resurgence.

3. Structural Perspective  
Sanders does not directly challenge Trump but uses "depolarization" to reactivate his narrative: anti-oligarch, anti-establishment, and unity for all. By rejecting the division of "red and blue states," he seeks to dismantle Trump's discourse dominance and shift from identity to interest politics, challenging the notion that "only Trump represents real America."

4. Key Variables  
- Clarity on Biden's intent to seek re-election could position Sanders as a "natural successor."
- If Trump scapegoats "blue states," Sanders' strategy may weaken his rhetoric.
- The backing of younger progressives like AOC and Ilhan Omar could determine the framework's momentum.
- Division within the Republican Party between "financial elites and populists" may solidify Sanders' narrative.

5. Trend Predictions  
- A failure to establish a new narrative center before the midterms may cement "billionaires vs. the people" as a cohesive framework.
- Sanders' model may be replicated by younger leftists through digital platforms to form a "departisan" alliance.
- Continued Trump's policies may lead to a new alliance opposing state rights narratives.
- If Trump uses the "blue states = crime zones" strategy, this would strengthen class issue centrality, supporting Sanders-type language.

LUMEN Structure Summary  
Sanders' remarks, while appearing to call for unity, suggest a realignment model based on economic structure. This operation seeks to reset political narratives from "geographical division" to "interest affiliation," activating discontent and reconstructing the coordinate system of American politics. Sanders is not just warming up for a campaign; he is rewriting part of the era's narrative.
