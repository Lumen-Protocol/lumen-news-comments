LUMEN INSIGHT: TRUMP PUSHES FOR FREE CANAL PASSAGE

# Summary
On April 26, 2025, Trump proposed on Truth Social that U.S. military and commercial ships should transit the Panama and Suez Canals for free, emphasizing America's role in supporting these waterways. His directive to Secretary of State Marco Rubio aims to redefine U.S. influence in global shipping negotiations, using a nationalist approach amid rising global trade tensions. Trump's statements challenge existing international maritime laws and propose a shift in sovereignty perception, implying the U.S. should receive special privileges as a key contributor. The reactions from Panama and Egypt, along with international shipping organizations, will significantly shape the potential escalation of conflicts and future shipping order dynamics.

1. Event Identification  
On April 26, 2025, Trump publicly stated on Truth Social that U.S. military and commercial ships should be allowed to pass through the Panama and Suez Canals for free, claiming these canals rely on American support and contributions. He has instructed Secretary of State Marco Rubio to address this issue immediately and to "remember" it.

2. Motivational Analysis  
Trump's core motivation is to reinforce the "U.S. contribution theory" to lay the groundwork for a new round of global shipping order negotiations while showcasing a strong nationalist stance domestically. Amid global trade tensions and rising conservative sentiments in the U.S., he seeks to redefine America's privileged status in the international waterway system, politicizing shipping channels as leverage for future economic and security negotiations.

3. Structural Perspective  
Trump's statements clearly aim to reconstruct the sovereignty and cost structure of existing international transport hubs. According to traditional international law, the Panama and Suez Canals are under the jurisdiction of their sovereign states (Panama and Egypt), with transit rules based on treaties and international practices. Trump's logic implies:

- As a key investor, builder, or maintainer, the U.S. should enjoy a supernational "fee exemption privilege";
- Canals should no longer be viewed solely as international public assets but partially as "U.S. international assets";
- Through executive orders (like Secretary of State involvement), a non-formal yet ongoing pressure method could alter the existing usage payment order.

This presents a conflict over channel sovereignty and contribution rights, which, if implemented, would challenge the current international shipping order systemically.

4. Critical Variables  
- Responses from the Panama and Egyptian governments: Their level of opposition or pursuit of multilateral support will determine the extent of conflict spillover;
- Positions of international shipping organizations and allies: Support or acquiescence from other countries regarding U.S. demands could destabilize the current shipping order; conversely, it could increase risks of U.S. isolation;
- Coordination of military and economic means: If the U.S. exerts pressure through military presence or trade negotiations, the speed of pressure transmission will accelerate;
- Changes in the domestic political cycle: If Trump's administration's approval fluctuates, the intensity and strategy of pressure may adjust, impacting the international response tempo.

5. Trend Prediction  
In the short term (3-6 months), Panama and Egypt are expected to express protests through diplomatic channels while avoiding direct confrontation to gain time and space. If the Trump administration continues to escalate this issue, it may prompt Latin American and Middle Eastern allies to reassess their dependency on the U.S. for transport, encouraging China and Europe to strengthen alternative channel investments (like Arctic routes or Mediterranean reinforcement plans). Starting in the second half of 2025, the U.S. may impose "canal rights" clauses in trade agreements, military aid, or currency support, formally incorporating navigation rights into the next phase of the global structural game.

LUMEN Structure Summary  
Trump's remarks are not merely emotional outbursts but a tentative attempt to fragment and asset-ify the international order of sovereignty. His assertion that "America should pass free" fundamentally reinjects traditional international travel laws with narratives of historical contributionism and power realism, challenging the current structure of international channels predicated on neutrality and equality. This attempt reflects a key trend in the LUMEN logic: the future international order will no longer be institutionally dominated but will emerge from a dual structure of contribution claims and power fulfillment in a variable sequence.
