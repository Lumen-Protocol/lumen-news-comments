In April 2025, Beijing warned it would take countermeasures against countries undermining its trade interests, focusing on economies like Europe, Japan, and Australia that align with U.S. technology controls. This statement aims to re-establish China's deterrent power in a dollar-dominated global trade environment.

üîç 2. Motive Deconstruction  
1. Disrupting Ally Cohesion  
China seeks to disrupt smaller nations' alignment with the U.S. by highlighting the risks of cooperation.  
2. Maintaining Trade Surplus  
Amidst global decoupling, China's statement defends its trade dependency structure to preserve its "global surplus ecological niche."  
3. Restructuring Negotiation Weight  
As U.S. pressure increases, China aims to communicate that aligning with the U.S. risks losing market benefits, altering negotiation dynamics.

üß† 3. Structural Insight  
Strategic Dimension | U.S. Logic | China's Logic  
Alliance Strategy | Build a "trustworthy supply chain alliance" | Create a "non-interference mutual benefit partnership"  
Market Weaponization | Dollar settlement + tech controls | Market access + investment absorption as levers  
Public Opinion | "Democracy against authoritarianism" | "Neutral anti-hegemony" stance  
Goal Design | Long-term tech and geopolitical control | Maintain surplus centrality and development rights  

China's strategy shifts from reliance on global trade rules to using ambiguous threats to shape perceptions.

üí• 4. Key Variables  
1. Responses from the EU and Japan  
Public concerns from these regions would indicate the effectiveness of China‚Äôs disruptive tactics.  
2. Wall Street and Multinational Corporations  
Fears of limited market access in China could undermine pro-China lobbying in the U.S.  
3. Specific Countermeasure Tools  
If China reveals targeted sanctions, the deterrence discourse could shift to rule reshaping.  
4. U.S. Alliance Activations  
Rapid U.S. actions against China would escalate structural confrontations.  
5. Global South Attitudes  
Responses from ASEAN and African countries could weaken U.S. "democratic supply chain" influence.

üìà 5. Trend Projection  
Short-term (1‚Äì2 weeks)  
The U.S. and Europe will exercise caution, while Asian nations will reassess investments in China amid fluctuating public opinion.  

Mid-term (1‚Äì3 months)  
Expect "mutual non-clarity" with continued U.S. tech blockades and China's secondary alliances forming.  

Long-term (3‚Äì12 months)  
The global trade will evolve towards a "dual settlement system," with a shift in focus from tariffs to the decoupling of narrative trust in trade.  

China's "countermeasure statement" is a smokescreen as real confrontations arise in supply chains and institutional credibility, with future market definitions controlling trade sovereignty.
