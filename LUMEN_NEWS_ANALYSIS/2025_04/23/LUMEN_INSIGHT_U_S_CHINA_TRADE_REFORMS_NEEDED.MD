# Title
LUMEN INSIGHT: U S CHINA TRADE REFORMS NEEDED

# Summary
U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent emphasized the need for reciprocal changes in U.S.-China relations amid ongoing trade tensions and global supply chain challenges. This shift in narrative from "blaming China" to a collaborative approach suggests a desire for mutual adjustments to balance global supply and demand. Key variables include whether China can transition to demand-driven growth and if the U.S. can stimulate its consumption. The outlook hints at potential bilateral reforms affecting global trade dynamics, while delays from China may prompt U.S. defensive measures. Ultimately, successful structural rebalancing could lead to greater stability in international economic systems.

# News Comment
1. Event Identification  
U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated that "China needs to change," signaling a need for "mutual transformation logic," indicating two-way adjustments amid U.S.-China trade tensions and global supply chain issues.

2. Motivation Analysis  
- Structural demand: The U.S. seeks to guide China to self-adjust to balance "global supply—demand—funding."
- Discourse shift: Moving from "blaming China" to "helping China" reflects a cooperative approach for potential negotiations.
- External narrative: Framing contradictions as "synchronous bilateral transformation needs" seeks broader G7 consensus on China.
- Domestic harmony: Signaling that "the U.S. also needs to change" addresses domestic imbalances and political polarization.

3. Structural Perspective (LLL)  
- Logical level: China's surplus production and U.S. hollow economy are interconnected; "rebalancing" aims to reduce excessive interdependence.
- Language level: Bessent’s phrase "Everyone knows it needs to change" creates a consensus, framing change as a systemic proposition.
- Connection level: China’s structural issues could disrupt U.S. re-industrialization plans.

4. Key Variables  
- Will China shift from "investment-driven" to "demand-driven" growth?
- Will the U.S. introduce fiscal measures to stimulate consumption and industry?
- Will a bilateral negotiation mechanism for "structural rebalancing" be established?
- Will it lead to new multilateral frameworks among economies like the EU and Japan?

5. Trend Forecast  
- "Bilateral structural reforms" may dominate U.S.-China dialogue post-"tariff war."
- Delays from China could lead to U.S. defensive measures against "asymmetric structures."
- U.S. political division may reduce "we also need to change" to mere compromise, increasing rifts.
- Successful rebalancing could stabilize global trade and monetary systems.

Structural Summary:  
Bessent's statement reflects a structural communication in global systems reconstruction, marking a shift from zero-sum narratives to "parallel restructuring." Both U.S. manufacturing and China's exports depend on mutual adjustments, indicating that change becomes a systemic necessity.
