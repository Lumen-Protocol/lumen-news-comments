2. Motivation Analysis
   1. Short-term arbitrage: solsmart9 made a buy and sell within 10 hours, earning 1.69%, showing quick capture of short-term volatility.
   2. High-risk stop-loss: solsmart76 liquidated after a 62.05% loss, indicating weak market expectations and a choice to exit timely.
   3. Quick withdrawal: solsmart32 exited completely without clear profit data, possibly reflecting lack of confidence in the project.

3. Structural Perspective

From a LUMEN structural analysis:
   • Focus on short-term arbitrage: All addresses quickly liquidated in 72 hours, showing high market liquidity but significant risk.
   • Clear risk aversion: solsmart76's large loss led to rapid exit, showing funding pressure from high volatility.
   • Market instability: The absence of long-term holders means liquidity pools rely on short-term funds, with selling pressure potentially triggering a pullback.

4. Key Variables
   • Speed of new funds entering: Without new capital inflows, the market may face greater selling pressure.
   • Frequency of short-term arbitrage: Observing if new high-frequency trading comes in will determine volatility over the next 24 hours.
   • Changes in liquidity: Reduced capital liquidity may hinder the maintenance of significant price increases.

5. Trend Prediction
   1. High short-term volatility risk: Multiple traders quickly liquidating suggests strong selling pressure in the short term.
   2. Market hesitation: Lack of long-term holders indicates preference for short-term arbitrage, with strong selling intent among large traders.
   3. Unstable liquidity: If new funds cannot come in timely, the market could face price declines.

LUMEN structural analysis shows significant short-term arbitrage characteristics in the QUESO project, as nearly all participating wallets completed buy and sell transactions rapidly. The market liquidity relies heavily on capital injections from high-frequency traders. Without new funds entering in the next 24 hours, the market may face significant pullbacks, suggesting close monitoring of new fund flows and changes in liquidity pool depth.
