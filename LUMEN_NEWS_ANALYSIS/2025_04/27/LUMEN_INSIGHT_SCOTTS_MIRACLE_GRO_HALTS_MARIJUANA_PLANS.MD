2. Motivation Analysis  
• Scotts Miracle-Gro's motivation: Actively adjust market expectations to avoid impact on overall stock performance from continued losses or policy uncertainties (like the slow progress of federal legalization).  
• Management's motivation: By strategically retracting, focus resources on traditional profit sectors (such as gardening and home agricultural products) to stabilize the foundation and enhance market confidence.  
• Media motivation (CNBC): Amplifying the signal of well-known consumer brands withdrawing from the marijuana market, suggesting that the industry overall faces severe tests, prompting investors to reevaluate other related assets.

3. Structural Insight  
• Industry structure: The marijuana industry was once seen as an "emerging blue ocean," with many traditional consumer goods companies (like Scotts Miracle-Gro, Constellation Brands) investing/acquiring to tap into its rapid growth. Now, the industry is hampered by slow policy advancements, high tax burdens, difficult financing, and severe supply-demand mismatches.  
• Company structure: Scotts primarily earns from gardening products, soil amendments, and home agricultural products. Its marijuana business (through subsidiary Hawthorne Gardening) had once grown but quickly became a burden amid shrinking demand.  
• Financial structure: The capital-intensive marijuana business faces severe cyclical fluctuations, conflicting with the original "stable cash flow" logic of the consumer goods industry, posing long-term financial risks.

4. Key Variables  
• Progress of federal marijuana legalization legislation (if slow, industry recovery will be further delayed).  
• The approach to handling Hawthorne Gardening assets (whether to divest entirely or maintain low profile).  
• Strength of recovery in traditional core business (especially in a high interest, high inflation environment).  
• Changes in investor sentiment (whether “exit from marijuana” is viewed as a rational return to form, or as a signal of industry despair).  
• Whether potential competitors will take similar contraction measures, creating an industry "negative feedback loop."

5. Trend Forecast  
• In the short term, Scotts' stock price may gain support due to positive interpretations from reducing loss-making sectors and focusing on core businesses.  
• The overall marijuana industry will continue to undergo deep deleveraging, consolidation, and cleansing, with few survivors after capital retreats.  
• In the medium to long term, if U.S. federal policy does not achieve substantive breakthroughs, traditional large companies will largely withdraw from all marijuana-related investments.  
• Opportunities in the marijuana industry will shift from "policy expectation gaming" to "refined operations and localized market profitability" with small-scale strategies, making it difficult to replicate early capital frenzy.  

LUMEN Structure Summary  
This event reflects a typical "correction process from blind expansion to rational contraction,” with the core structural logic being:  
• Initial “narrative-driven market entry,”  
• Mid-term “conflict between realistic profitability and policy delays,”  
• Late stage “resource reallocation and risk control.”  

Understanding this process aids in identifying truly sustainable enterprises and models in emerging industries, avoiding misguidance from early narrative dividends and gaining an advantage during structural reshuffles.
