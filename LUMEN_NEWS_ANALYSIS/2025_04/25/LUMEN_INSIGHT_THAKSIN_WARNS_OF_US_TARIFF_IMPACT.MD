LUMEN INSIGHT: THAKSIN WARNS OF US TARIFF IMPACT

# Summary
Former Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra warns that impending U.S. tariffs may critically impact Thailand's export-driven economy, calling for immediate reforms in import controls and investment promotion. He emphasizes the necessity for Thailand to transition from a trade-dependent structure to an industry-oriented and regional capital hub, advocating for foreign investment and industry upgrades to foster endogenous growth. Analyzing structural vulnerabilities amid U.S.-China trade dynamics, he notes that Thailand's reliance on exports makes it susceptible to external policy shifts. Thaksin's insights point towards a need for strategic autonomy and resilience to stabilize Thailand’s economic future amidst global challenges.

1. Event Identification  
Former Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra warned that upcoming tariffs from the U.S. could severely impact Thailand's export-oriented economy and urged the Thai government to reform import controls and investment promotion policies immediately.

2. Motivation Analysis  
Thaksin's statement reflects his long-term understanding of Thailand's economic structure, acknowledging that the heavy reliance on exports, especially to the U.S., makes Thailand overly sensitive to external policy changes. He also called for the current government to expedite structural reforms, shifting from "trade dependency" to "industry orientation" and "regional capital hub". Additionally, he has emphasized the need to attract foreign investment and upgrade industries, arguing that adjustments in investment policy are essential for developing an endogenous growth system in Thailand.

3. Structural Perspective  
Thailand's export-led model reveals vulnerabilities under the current trends of global de-risking and the politicization of tariffs. Its economic structure is deeply tied to global supply chains, particularly influenced by U.S.-China trade dynamics. U.S. tariffs do not hit Thailand directly but undermine its embedded advantages in the value chain (such as transshipment, contract manufacturing, and regional integration). This structural dilemma illustrates an asymmetric game chain of "small open economy → shock from global powers' tariffs → weakened policy autonomy". In this context, Thailand can only resist external rule erosion through "import substitution" and "industrial upstreaming".

4. Key Variables  
- The speed of trade structure adjustment between the U.S. and Thailand will determine whether Thai exports can quickly shift to ASEAN or European markets.  
- The elasticity of Thai government investment policies will affect the ability to attract supply chain segments displaced by China or Vietnam.  
- Whether the U.S.-China tariff war escalates will impact Thailand's positioning as an industrial intermediary between the two.  
- The degree of supply chain integration within ASEAN will determine whether Thailand can evolve into a regional logistics and industrial coordination center.

5. Trend Forecast  
In the short term, Thai exports may face substantial declines, particularly in sectors highly dependent on the U.S., such as electronics, automotive parts, and agricultural products. In the medium term, if the government successfully optimizes import controls and guides foreign investment towards mid-to-high-end manufacturing and infrastructure, Thailand could transform into "the Poland of ASEAN"—an alternative regional production node. In the long term, Thailand must break its strategic dependence on a single major market and seek a stable, independent value chain positioning between the U.S. and China.

LUMEN Structural Summary  
Thailand's structural vulnerability is evident not only in the volatility of export data but also in its marginal position within global rules. As tariffs become geopolitical tools, nations like Thailand, lacking "rule sovereignty", must reconstruct policy coordinates with structural rationality. Thaksin's call reflects a reconsideration of the national "trade structure dependency" and a rational awakening emphasizing that "structural resilience outweighs growth rates". From the LUMEN perspective, this transformation from dependency to autonomy is not merely a policy slogan, but a survival logic.
