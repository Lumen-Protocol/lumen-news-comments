2. Motivation Analysis

Under Armour faces major challenges from continued weak market demand and declining capital allocation efficiency. The lackluster currency growth indicates a weakening global competitiveness of the brand, necessitating product improvements and market expansion to reverse the trend. Furthermore, the expected decline in sales over the next year shows a diminishing consumer interest in its products, threatening long-term growth.

3. Structural Perspective

From a LUMEN structural perspective, Under Armour has three notable structural issues:
   1. Weak Market Demand: Currency-denominated growth has not met expectations over the past two years, indicating a decline in brand effect and product appeal, making it difficult to maintain market share.
   2. Continuous Negative Free Cash Flow: A -2.9% free cash flow margin exposes the company's consumption of funds exceeding creation, with cash inflows insufficient to support business expansion.
   3. Ineffective Capital Allocation: The weak return on capital reflects management's inefficiency in utilizing funds, failing to effectively drive innovation or market expansion.

LUMEN Structural Analysis

Under Armour's main challenges stem from ongoing weak market demand and cash flow pressures, making it more challenging to expand in the market. Without swift improvements in product competitiveness and cash flow management, the brand's long-term viability will be at risk. Refocusing on core products and enhancing global market expansion could be key to reversing the situation.
