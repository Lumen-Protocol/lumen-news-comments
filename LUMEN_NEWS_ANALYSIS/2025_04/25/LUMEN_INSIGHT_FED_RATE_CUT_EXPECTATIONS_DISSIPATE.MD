LUMEN INSIGHT: FED RATE CUT EXPECTATIONS DISSIPATE

# Summary
On April 25, 2025, MarketWatch highlighted the waning expectations of Federal Reserve interest rate cuts, indicating the Fed's reluctance to ease despite tariff pressures and declining profits, as seen with PepsiCo. This reluctance is reflective of the Fed's effort to maintain monetary policy neutrality amidst President Trump's interventions, structural inflation concerns, and fiscal uncertainties. The traditional path to economic stimulus is transforming, leading to a potential “uncertain stagnation.” Key variables, such as inflation rates and political pressures, will determine the Fed's future actions, with implications for market volatility, corporate investment behaviors, and the dynamics between the Fed and the White House.

# News Comment
1. Event Identification

On April 25, 2025, MarketWatch reported that the market's expectation of interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve (Fed) in early summer this year has largely dissipated. This signals that despite facing tariff impacts and declining corporate profits (as seen with PepsiCo), the Fed is not yet prepared to implement easing measures to mitigate growth risks.

2. Motivation Analysis

The “dissipation” of Fed rate cut expectations reflects a complex interplay between institutions and markets:
   • The Fed is attempting to maintain a symbolic continuity of “monetary policy neutrality”: In the context of President Trump’s frequent statements and interventions regarding central bank independence, the Fed's delay in rate cuts serves as a form of institutional self-defense.
   • Concerns over revived inflation remain embedded structurally: Due to the compounded effects of energy, tariffs, and wage pressures, the Fed’s outlook on structural inflation has become more cautious, tightening policy space.
   • Keeping rates steady is also a way to address fiscal uncertainties: By refraining from cutting rates in light of Trump's aggressive fiscal expansion and trade interventions, the Fed is essentially not endorsing government policies that rely on “tariff stimulation of the economy.”

3. Structural Perspective

The discourse surrounding the “dissipation of rate cut expectations” essentially represents a “structural game of policy choices”:
   • The tension between fiscal and monetary policies is redefining market pricing rules: Structural fiscal expansion (tax cuts, tariffs) alongside restrained monetary policy means that monetary policy no longer serves as a stimulative tool but as a risk-hedging anchor.
   • The logic of a “soft landing” is evolving into “uncertain stagnation”: The original market assumption was “rate hikes → wait and see → rate cut stimulus,” but the actual path is “rate hikes → high-level stagnation → waiting for fiscal structure clarity → redirection”;
   • Market confidence in the central bank's path is being eroded by “structural policy ambiguity”: On one hand, there is concern about compressed central bank independence; on the other, there is fear that if the economy slows down, further rate cuts will be ineffective.

4. Key Variables
   • Whether the CPI and core PCE in May and June will significantly decline will determine if the Fed maintains the possibility of mid-year actions;
   • Whether the Trump administration will strongly criticize the Fed's “inaction,” reviving the “Powell is disobedient” narrative;
   • Whether the market (especially tech and real estate) will begin to show valuation discontinuities due to a persistently tight financing environment;
   • Whether the yield curve for government bonds will remain inverted, signaling a market response of "disappointment pricing."

5. Trend Forecast

As the expectation for rate cuts dissipates, global capital markets will redefine the “interest rate environment assumptions”:
   • Short-term stock market volatility is likely to rise, particularly in interest-sensitive growth sectors;
   • Companies will continue to adopt cash flow defensive strategies in the “high-interest era,” diminishing their willingness to expand investments;
   • The U.S. dollar is expected to remain strong, exerting a reverse squeeze on capital in emerging markets;
   • The policy tension between the Fed and the White House may escalate into a peak of institutional conflict, becoming the focal point of global central bank vigilance regarding “institutional independence.”

In summary, “not cutting rates” is not merely a technical judgment, but a test of institutional strength. The Fed's adherence to neutrality may come at the cost of entering a collision phase with the entire “Trump-style policy framework.”
