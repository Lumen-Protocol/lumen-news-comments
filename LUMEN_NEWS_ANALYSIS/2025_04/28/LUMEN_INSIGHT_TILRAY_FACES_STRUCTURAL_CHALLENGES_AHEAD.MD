The goal has changed from expansion to maintaining market positions and restoring trust.

3. Structural Perspective  
Tilray's structural issues include:

- Ineffective growth model: Mergers lacked integration, diluting profit margins.  
- Weak profitability: Cannabis products face pricing pressures and competition, leading to declining margins.  
- Deteriorating capital structure: Continuous losses and high cash consumption have diluted shareholder equity.  
- Complex management: Low internal synergy raises operational costs.  
- Policy risks: Delays in cannabis legalization in the U.S. have stunted expected demand.  

4. Key Variables  

- Cost control: Reducing expenses could slow cash depletion.  
- Asset divestiture: Selling non-core businesses could improve cash flow.  
- Regulatory changes: Progress on U.S. cannabis legalization could boost demand.  
- Market acquisition: A merger into a larger platform could mitigate shareholder losses.

5. Trend Forecast  
Tilray will face pressures from cash consumption, limited financing, and declining returns. Without external catalysts, the stock is expected to experience high volatility downward. In the medium to long term, the company must focus on profitable categories and control capital expenditures to avoid losing market trust. Otherwise, it may face "gradual bankruptcy-style contraction," shrinking or requiring forced sales.

LUMEN Structure Summary:  
Tilray exemplifies "high-growth narrative failure," with its initial success hampered by lagging market developments and management issues. It faces deep structural losses and lacks a clear path to profitability, making any market rebound more a liquidity gamble than a return to value. Tilray must choose between cash and growth.
