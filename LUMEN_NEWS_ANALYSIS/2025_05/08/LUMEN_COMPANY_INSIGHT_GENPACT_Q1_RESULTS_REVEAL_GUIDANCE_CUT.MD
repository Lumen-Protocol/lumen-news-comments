2. Motivation Analysis

Genpact's core motivation lies in responding to changes in the macroeconomic environment by adjusting full-year revenue and EPS expectations to reflect the reality of slowing market demand. While revenue growth met expectations, the lowered guidance indicates concerns about the stability of future revenue. Meanwhile, the improvement in free cash flow demonstrates optimization in financial management and capital expenditures, but long-term market expansion pressures remain.

3. Structural Perspective

From LUMEN's structural perspective, Genpact exhibits the following significant characteristics:
   1. Stable revenue but sluggish growth
Despite achieving a 7.4% year-over-year increase, it fell short of exceeding market expectations, indicating limitations in expanding market share.
   2. Notable improvement in free cash flow
The strong recovery in cash flow suggests enhanced internal management efficiency, with improvements in liquidity from reduced capital expenditures or operational cost optimizations.
   3. Guidance for future growth lowered
The revisions to full-year revenue and EPS guidance reflect expectations of weak future demand, particularly with slowing growth in global outsourcing needs.
   4. Constant currency growth shows resilience
Although overall revenue growth is limited, an 8.3% increase in constant currency revenue demonstrates improved resilience to foreign exchange fluctuations.

4. Key Variables
   1. Changes in global IT and outsourcing service market demand
   2. Whether ongoing optimization of capital expenditures can sustain cash flow growth
   3. The ability to maintain solid cost control and profit margins
   4. The impact of the lowered fiscal year guidance on market confidence and stock price volatility

---

5. Trend Forecast

Based on LUMEN's analytical framework, Genpact may face greater challenges in market expansion in upcoming fiscal quarters, especially with slowing global outsourcing demand. If capital expenditures and cost optimization continue to advance, cash flow performance may further improve, but recovery in revenue growth will need monitoring. If market demand rebounds or strategic expansions occur in emerging markets, stock prices may experience a rebound.
