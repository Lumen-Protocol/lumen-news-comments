LUMEN INSIGHT: LEE JAEMYUNG TRADE STRATEGY OUTLINED

# Summary
South Korean presidential candidate Lee Jae-myung has outlined a strategic plan to stabilize the economy through U.S. trade negotiations and a fiscal budget, responding to global trade protectionism and domestic inflation. His approach combines negotiations addressing tariffs and technological standards with fiscal support for domestic industries. However, uncertainties associated with Trump's negotiation style, potential Congressional opposition, and the need to balance U.S.-China relations present challenges. Should Lee win the June 3 election, negotiations could initially focus on semiconductors and tariffs, but ineffective fiscal measures could worsen economic instability by late 2025, threatening South Korea's industrial integrity amid global pressures.

# News Comment
1. Event Identification  
South Korean presidential candidate Lee Jae-myung announced that if he wins the election on June 3, he will focus on trade negotiations with the U.S. and push for a fiscal budget to stabilize the economy. This reflects South Korea's strategic response to global trade protectionism.

2. Motivation Analysis  
Lee's proposal is motivated by the pressures of the Trump administration's tariffs on South Korea's export-dependent economy and domestic issues like inflation and weak youth employment. By negotiating with the U.S., Lee aims to secure tariff exemptions for South Korean businesses, while fiscal expansion intends to stabilize the economy, showcasing his crisis management capabilities.

3. Structural Perspective  
Lee's strategy combines "frontline negotiation—backline support":  
Negotiations with the U.S. will address tariffs and broader issues like technology standards and supply chain security. The additional budget will bolster domestic industries against job losses and declining demand, acting as a mechanism to filter external shocks and maintain stability.

4. Key Variables  
- Uncertainty in Trump's negotiation style complicates expectations for South Korea's negotiations.  
- Congressional power distribution may hinder fiscal budget expansion if Lee faces opposition.  
- Balancing U.S. cooperation with economic ties to China presents a structural risk.  
- Perceptions of South Korea as a passive market responder could lead to currency depreciation and capital outflow risks.

5. Trend Forecast  
If Lee Jae-myung wins, U.S. negotiations will focus on semiconductor export restrictions, automobile tariffs, and subsidies. Initial relations may be positive; however, increasing pressure from Trump could lead to passive negotiations if South Korea lacks leverage. Ineffective fiscal expansion targeting could worsen debt issues, leading to critical transitions by late 2025.

LUMEN Structure Summary  
Lee Jae-myung’s strategy seeks to address "global inflation—tariff barriers—technological decoupling" by leveraging trade negotiations for national support and using additional budgets for social continuity. His goal is to preserve South Korea's industrial integrity amid global structural challenges, reflecting a response mechanism of a secondary sovereign entity seeking survival through rational leverage.
