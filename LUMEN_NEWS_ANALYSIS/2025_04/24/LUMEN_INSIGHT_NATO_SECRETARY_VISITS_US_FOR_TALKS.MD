LUMEN INSIGHT: NATO SECRETARY VISITS US FOR TALKS

# Summary
NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte's upcoming visit to Washington, D.C. on April 24-25, 2025, aims to redefine U.S.-NATO cooperation in light of Trump's second term. With key meetings involving U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, and National Security Advisor Mike Waltz, the discussions will center on resource allocation and responsibility-sharing in the backdrop of shifting U.S. foreign strategy. The outcomes are expected to set a "structural tacit understanding" for NATO's future role amidst geopolitical tensions, particularly in Ukraine and Eastern Europe, all while adapting to a transactional U.S. diplomatic approach under Trump.

1. Event Identification  
From April 24 to 25, 2025, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte will visit Washington, D.C., to meet U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, and National Security Advisor Mike Waltz. This information was released by an official NATO spokesperson, confirming that the trip involves high-level multilateral talks.

2. Motivation Analysis  
The primary motivation for this visit is to reshape the framework and priorities of U.S.-NATO cooperation following the start of Trump's second term. Following a swift adjustment of foreign strategy under Trump, particularly regarding the redistribution of European security responsibilities and renegotiation of military spending, NATO is keen for the Secretary General to assert its strategic positioning in this new period. Additionally, the U.S. delegation represents the core triangle of Trump's foreign and security policy, aiming to establish direct communication with this key group.

3. Structural Perspective  
The core structure of this event involves the reconstruction of interactions within a trilateral network:  
- NATO-U.S. Bilateral Structure: After financial disputes during Trump's first term, NATO's visit aims to achieve clearer consensus on responsibility-sharing and resource allocation through high-level engagements.  
- U.S. Internal Security Strategy Structure: Rubio, Hegseth, and Waltz respectively represent diplomacy, military deployment, and intelligence coordination, playing crucial roles in Trump 2.0’s strategy of “U.S.-led reorganization of NATO.” Their attitudes toward Rutte will directly influence NATO's bargaining power.  
- Reconstruction of U.S.-European Overall Strategic Structure: Amid ongoing conflicts in Ukraine, Middle Eastern energy dynamics, and China's expansion in East Asia, U.S.-European relations need redefined cooperation boundaries. Rutte's task is to clarify mutual goals and responsibilities.

4. Key Variables  
- Trump's Firmness on NATO Strategy: If Trump 2.0 continues a transactional alliance view, discussions may focus on cost-benefit analyses, potentially requiring NATO to make concessions.  
- Secretary of State Rubio's Diplomatic Style: As a hawkish representative, his push for a stronger geopolitical stance may constrain NATO’s policy autonomy.  
- Evolution of Russia and Eastern Europe’s Battle Conditions: Any escalation in the Ukraine war will influence NATO’s resource allocation and operational pace in Eastern Europe, impacting Trump's reliance on NATO.  
- Internal Consistency within NATO: If France and Germany exhibit strategic splits, Rutte's negotiating power will be severely limited, undermining the visit's outcomes.

5. Trend Prediction  
This meeting is unlikely to produce immediate major strategic declarations but is expected to establish a framework for "structural tacit understanding," initiating a phase of NATO rebalancing centered around the U.S. In the short term, NATO may concede certain fiscal and readiness responsibilities, while the U.S. will leverage NATO as a supportive structure in its Indo-Pacific and Russia-Europe dual strategy, strengthening its global competitive positioning. Additionally, Rubio will play a central role in coordinating U.S.-European topics, and his relationship with Rutte will directly affect the diplomatic flexibility of NATO countries moving forward.

LUMEN Structural Summary  
This event reflects a triple coupling of "Power-Structure-Strategic Nodes" in the LUMEN model: the U.S. is returning to a transaction-based structural diplomacy in the Trump 2.0 era, while NATO, as a system centered on rules and security interdependence, must adapt under this new power dynamic. Rutte’s proactive visit to the U.S. represents a structural compromise, responding to changes in strategic power through institutional rationality and embodying a collective soft power survival strategy.
