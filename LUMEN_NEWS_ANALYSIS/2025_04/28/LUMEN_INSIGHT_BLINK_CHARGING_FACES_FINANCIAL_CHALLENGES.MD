2. Motivation Analysis  
Blink aims to capture the growing electric vehicle infrastructure market in the U.S., relying on capital market financing for expansion. Management prioritizes revenue growth and market share over profitability, hoping to reverse the situation through economies of scale and future policy support, creating a “land grab first, profit later” approach.

3. Structural Perspective  
Blink's business structure shows imbalances:  
• Financing-led: Frequent share issuance dilutes existing shareholder interests.  
• Deteriorating cash flow: Negative gross margins and operating cash flow, with financing outpacing revenue growth.  
• Distant profitability: Core products have yet to achieve positive unit economics; charging stations operate at a loss.  
• Path dependence: Reliance on external funding and market sentiment; tighter market conditions would severely limit financing capacity.

4. Key Variables  
• Capital market environment: Tightening preferences for tech growth stocks could hinder BLNK's refinancing.  
• Policy subsidy changes: New incentives for EV charging infrastructure may alleviate funding pressure temporarily.  
• Improvement in unit economics: Proving break-even for charging stations could improve investor expectations.  
• Competitive landscape changes: Larger companies could further pressure Blink's survival.

5. Trend Forecast  
In the short term, Blink will continue to rely on share dilutions for financing, hindering earnings per share recovery. In the medium term, without improvements in profitability or policy support, the company faces risks of stock price decline, forced reorganization, or delisting. Despite a low price (0.6x P/S), risks of capital dilution, losses, and industry reshuffling make it high-risk for investors.

LUMEN Structure Summary:  
Blink Charging is in a "financing-led" growth trap: cash outflows exceed income, and imbalanced unit economics hinder self-rescue, relying on external capital. As high interest rates and capital market risks grow, its financing environment worsens, exposing business fragility. Without achieving profitability or external support, Blink faces value shrinkage due to its deteriorating capital structure and operational fundamentals.
