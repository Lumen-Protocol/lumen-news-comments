1. Event Identification  
IAC (NASDAQ: IAC) released its financial report for the first quarter of 2025, but due to the completion of its spin-off transaction of Angi on March 31, the financial data for this quarter is not comparable to historical data and market expectations. Key data are as follows:  

• Revenue: $571 million vs market expectation of $809 million (decrease of 38.6% year-on-year, below expectation by 29.5%)  
• GAAP EPS: -$2.64 vs market expectation of -$2.03 (variance of 30.1%, significantly below expectations)  
• Adjusted EBITDA: $50.9 million vs expectation of $19 million (profit margin of 8.9%, a significant outperformance)  
• Full-year EBITDA guidance raised to $267.5 million (above expected $251.1 million)  
• Operating Margin: 6.3%, compared to -6.4% in the same period last year  
• Free Cash Flow: -$4.6 million, compared to $48.34 million in the same period last year  
• Current market value: $2.83 billion  

2. Motivation Analysis  
Management proactively restructured the financial reporting metrics following the spin-off of Angi to clearly define the operational boundaries and profit model of the "new IAC." Highlighting the EBITDA that surpassed expectations and a significant recovery in Operating Margin aims to convey the message that the proceeds from the spin-off retain profit potential, stabilizing investor confidence. The spin-off may also free cash flow to support future potential acquisitions or growth of its own platforms.  

3. Structural Perspective  
IAC is primarily a holding platform centered on incubating, operating, and splitting internet companies. After the separation of Angi, its remaining asset portfolio (such as Dotdash Meredith, Care.com, etc.) focuses on content, services, and vertical platforms. The current financial structure shows that although revenue has dropped significantly, profitability metrics like EBITDA and Operating Margin have improved, indicating that the remaining assets are more cost-effective. Additionally, negative cash flow reflects financial friction during the short-term restructuring.   

4. Key Variables  
• Impact of the spin-off transaction on taxes, one-time expenses, and amortizations.  
• The pace of the advertising recovery for the remaining platforms (like Dotdash Meredith).  
• Whether there are new investments or acquisitions entering the growth trajectory.  
• Future capital strategy preference between self-operated vs. shareholding structure.  
• Clarity on the path to positive free cash flow.  

5. Trend Forecast  
In the short term, IAC will continue to face valuation compression and structural reassessment pressure. The market will focus on the independent profitability of assets after the spin-off and new capital operations trends. If platforms like Dotdash can show resilience in the advertising market recovery in the second half of the year, growth expectations may resume in the second half of 2025. Currently, market pricing is close to the asset bottom value; if the company announces new acquisitions or spin-offs again, it could serve as a catalyst for valuation. The mid-term trend appears to be volatile, with long-term performance dependent on capital allocation efficiency.
