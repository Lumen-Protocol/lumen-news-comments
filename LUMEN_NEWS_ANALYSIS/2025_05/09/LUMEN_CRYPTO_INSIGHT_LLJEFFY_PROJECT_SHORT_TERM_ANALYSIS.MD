2. Motivation Analysis
   1. Short-term Arbitrage and Quick Stop Loss: The trading behavior of solsmart81 and solsmart88 shows a quick stop loss amid market decline to avoid larger losses.
   2. Periodic Profit Taking: solsmart72 cleared 20 hours ago with a 14.55% return, showcasing short-term arbitrage capability.

3. Structural Perspective

From a LUMEN structural analysis:
   • Short-term High-Frequency Trading: There are notable instances of short-term high-frequency buying and selling, particularly solsmart72's successful arbitrage indicates short-term fluctuation potential.
   • Heavy Selling Pressure: The quick stop losses from solsmart81 and solsmart88 indicate a lack of short-term market confidence, with large holders preferring to avoid long positions.
   • Rapid Capital Flow: The quick in-and-out rates of major wallets without forming effective support lead to noticeable price pressure.

---

4. Key Variables
   • New Capital Entry: The entrance of new Smart Traders after the existing main wallets clear will determine if the short-term decline can be halted.
   • Stability of Liquidity Depth: Although trading volume is large, the rapid withdrawal of major players leads to insufficient market depth, increasing the risk of greater price volatility.
   • Possibility of Short-term Rebound: Without new buying support, a short-term recovery is difficult, necessitating observation of large on-chain transactions.

5. Trend Forecast
   1. Amplified Short-term Fluctuations: After the main wallets clear, the selling pressure remains, with expectations of more speculators selling in the short term.
   2. Increased Pullback Pressure: The exit of main wallets has not been matched with significant new funds, potentially leading the market to continue downward.
   3. Future Observation Focus: Monitor for new large buy orders on-chain and changes in liquidity pools to dictate the market's short-term direction.

LUMEN Structural Analysis

The LLJEFFY project has recently shown significant short-term volatility, with major wallets engaging in high-frequency trading and rapid exits, reflecting a lack of long-term confidence in the market. Current on-chain liquidity support is weak; without new capital inflow, a rebound is unlikely in the short term, recommending close monitoring of capital flow direction and actions from new large holders.
