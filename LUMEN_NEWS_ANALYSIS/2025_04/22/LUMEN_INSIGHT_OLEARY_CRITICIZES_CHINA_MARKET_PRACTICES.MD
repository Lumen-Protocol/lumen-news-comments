🎯 Structural Judgment

O’Leary’s comments reflect a shift in how capital views China, once seen as a "cost paradise," now recast as a "rules black hole." This critique comes from major capital figures, indicating a concern for "unfairness" over decoupling. The trade focus has shifted from tariffs to assessing "structural trust," with China at risk of losing essential trust among investors.
