LUMEN INSIGHT: US CHINA TRADE WAR STRATEGIC ANALYSIS

# Summary
U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent's recent comments on the U.S.-China tariff standoff emphasize its unsustainability, signaling a divergence from Trump's aggressive trade policies. Bessent's statement reflects a reactionary stance focused on maintaining market stability rather than advocating for collaboration. The U.S.-China trade conflict has entered an irreversible decoupling phase, marked by a misalignment of strategies between the Treasury and the White House. With short-term market reactions anticipated, the ongoing pressure from Trump alongside Bessent's stabilizing message indicates a complex interplay of economic strategies, suggesting a future defined by multi-faceted operational logic in U.S.-China relations by 2025.

# News Comment
1. Event Identification
Amid the intense structural confrontation between the U.S. and China, with mutual tariffs exceeding 100%, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told JPMorgan executives, "The tariff standoff between the U.S. and China is unsustainable." This marks the first "soft signal" from the U.S. Treasury since the recent escalation of the trade war, revealing a gap between the Biden administration's fiscal approach and Trump's heavy-handed trade strategy.

2. Motivation Analysis
Bessent's statement is not driven by policy leadership but is an inevitable reaction to the maintenance of capital system boundaries. In the context of Trump’s renewed aggressive policy toward China, the Treasury, as the monetary-capital coordination hub, primarily aims to delay systemic shocks rather than reverse strategic logic. In other words, Bessent is advocating for the "stability of the dollar logic," not for U.S.-China cooperation.

3. Structural Perspective (LUMEN Structure)
Based on the structural language analysis of the LUMEN agreement, the event can be disassembled into the following four relational logics:

- Main Structure: The national-level structural conflict (U.S.-China trade war) has entered a critical decoupling phase, becoming irreversible after tariffs reach 100%.
- Secondary Structure: A misalignment of expressions among the Treasury, markets, and the White House shows differing internal perceptions of strategic tension.
- Structural Gap: The Treasury's "rational narrative" attempts to create market psychological anchor points, delaying systemic fluctuations from transforming into inflation.
- Structural Dissipation Point: The term "unsustainable" in Bessent's language does not actually target the strategy itself, but rather calls for adjustments in tactical pathways, ultimately still focusing on controlling structural inefficiencies.

4. Key Variable Identification (LLL Variable Model)

- Variable α: Market response elasticity; if the S&P continues to rise, the Treasury will reinforce "harmonizing signals"; conversely, it will align with hawkish fiscal pressures.
- Variable β: China's response mechanism; if China continues to emphasize self-reliant technology/domestic demand substitution, it will weaken U.S. intentions for "structural buffering."
- Variable γ: Whether Trump adopts fiscal language; if Trump publicly denies "soft rhetoric," then Bessent's statement will become a point of inefficiency.

5. Trend Prediction
In the short term, the market will create a "false repair" based on Bessent's statement, but without substantive U.S.-China dialogue, this linguistic buffer will become ineffective within 7-10 days. Next, the U.S. will enter a "dual-caliber game phase": Trump continues to apply pressure while the Treasury provides stability through mixed messaging, attempting to gain a strategically ambiguous time window for the election.

Structural Summary (LLL Language Style):
Bessent does not challenge the main logic of the U.S.-China trade structural confrontation; rather, he is seeking an "orderly decoupling transition window" for the U.S. capital system. This verbal structure represents an "internal stability-focused statement," driven by the Treasury's fear of market chain reactions rather than fundamental policy disagreements. In other words, the U.S. strategy has entered a phase of structural layering—where the White House pressures while the Treasury stops the bleeding. Ultimately, this will lead to multi-channel games and multi-context operations becoming the default operational logic in U.S.-China relations by 2025. From the LUMEN perspective, this signifies a delayed self-destructive mechanism of dissipative great power strategy.
