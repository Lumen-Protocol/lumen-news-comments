# Title
LUMEN INSIGHT: CHINA FACES GLOBAL MARKET CHALLENGE

# Summary
In April 2025, China expert Gordon G. Chang commented on China's economic decline, citing India's import tariff on Chinese steel as a key factor in its "global market exclusion." This development marks a pivot from Western-led initiatives toward a united front within the global South, particularly with India's efforts to assert itself as a "rule-maker." The structural dynamics of global trade are shifting, with the U.S. influencing countries to reduce dependency on China. Key questions arise about potential Chinese retaliation, the solidification of U.S.-India supply chains, and the broader implications for China's manufacturing and export strategies.

# News Comment
üß© 1. Event Identification

In April 2025, China expert Gordon G. Chang tweeted about China experiencing "global market exclusion," referencing India‚Äôs 12% import tariff on Chinese steel to combat "cheap dumping." This signals a shift from a Western-led initiative to one involving the global South, particularly India.

Chang stated, "China is not just losing the U.S. market; it is being gradually expelled from the global market," highlighting a structural challenge to China's trade power.

üîç 2. Motive Deconstruction
1. The U.S.-led de-China alliance is expanding.
The U.S. influences global South countries to reduce dependence on China, reflected in India‚Äôs tariff.
2. India aims to be a "rule-maker."
By implementing this tariff, India seeks to influence "de-Chinese manufacturing" while maintaining "Southern autonomy."
3. China's surplus capacity is being blocked.
India‚Äôs tariffs obstruct China's attempt to transfer excess production to South and Southeast Asia.
4. Chang supports his views of China's decline.
He interprets India‚Äôs actions as evidence that China is losing control over the global economic structure.

üß† 3. Structural Insight

Structure Dimension | U.S. Logic | China Logic | Current Evolution
--- | --- | --- | ---
Trade Status | Joint Alliances ‚Üí Restructuring ‚Üí Diversifying | Strengthening Exports ‚Üí Stabilizing ‚Üí Expanding | Countries lean towards "avoiding China"
Public Opinion | Manufacturing Trust ‚Üí Risk Output | Growth Output ‚Üí Avoiding Imbalance | Opinion shifts to U.S. strategy
Chain Control | Controlling Technologies + Standards | Controlling Capacity + Prices | U.S. gains power, China struggles
Reputation Tools | "Indo-Pacific Framework," Chip4, AUKUS | RCEP, BRICS+, Belt and Road | U.S. tools expand, China shows fatigue

This illustrates a victory in "power structure transfer," driven by the U.S. inspiring India to adopt its structural approach.

üí• 4. Key Variables
1. Will China retaliate against India?
Retaliation would indicate that China's "global cooperation" narrative has collapsed.
2. Will the U.S. and India solidify a supply chain agreement?
If so, China will lose significant influence.
3. Will other Southeast Asian countries follow India's lead?
If they impose restrictions, China's regional power will decline.
4. Will China‚Äôs RMB settlement efforts fail?
Preference for "rule security" could undermine "de-dollarization."
5. Will internal capital outflow rise in China?
This could worsen internal vulnerabilities amidst shrinking external markets.

‚Äî

üìà 5. Trend Projection

Short-term (0‚Äì3 months)
Indian steel prices rise, while China‚Äôs exports drop, leading to business decoupling.

Mid-term (3‚Äì9 months)
A trend of "self-limiting Chinese manufacturing" appears, with the U.S. reclaiming authority in global trade institutions.

Long-term (9‚Äì18 months)
China‚Äôs export model adjusts, showing signs of "strong manufacturing but weak exports," allowing the U.S. to achieve a "structural victory" without conflict.

‚Äî

Chang views the U.S. as winning a structural war without direct confrontation, while China faces increasing challenges. The U.S. no longer needs slogans; structural changes, like India's tariffs, speak volumes.
