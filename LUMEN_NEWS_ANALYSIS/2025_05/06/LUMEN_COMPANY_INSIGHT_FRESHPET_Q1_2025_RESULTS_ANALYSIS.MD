   - Adjusted EBITDA: $35.53 million vs. expected $34.14 million (13.5% margin, 4.1% above expectations)  
   - Operating Margin: -4.4%, significantly down from 3.8% last year  
   - Free Cash Flow: -$21.68 million, an improvement over -$41.07 million last year  
   - Full-year revenue guidance lowered to $1.14 billion (down from $1.20 billion, a 5% decline, 3.2% below expectations)  
   - Full-year EBITDA guidance set at $200 million, below the expected $205 million  
   - Organic revenue growth: up 17.6% year-over-year  

2. Motive Analysis  
Freshpet's decision to lower its full-year guidance amid sustained revenue growth indicates management faces unresolved cost pressures and significant challenges to profitability. The core motive is to sustain brand growth while slowing capital expenditure to ease future financing pressures. This “growth-first, profit-later” strategy carries high risk, especially in a rising capital cost environment.  

3. Structural Insight  
The company's structure is characterized as “high growth + weak profitability + slowly deteriorating cash flow”:  
   - Strong revenue growth and EBITDA beating expectations show ongoing market penetration  
   - However, the switch from positive to negative operating margin and significantly worse-than-expected GAAP losses highlight issues with cost control, pricing strategy, or capital expenditures  
   - Lower guidance impacts market sentiment, indicating high growth has not translated to strong confidence  

4. Key Variables  
   - Overall demand elasticity in the fresh pet food segment and industry price war intensification  
   - Freshpet's customer acquisition cost (CAC) and channel efficiency  
   - Whether gross margin recovery can keep pace with rising operational expenditures  
   - Potential inventory buildup or increased promotional spending in Q2 that could further compress margins  
   - Risks of additional financing needs or pressures to adjust capital structure  

5. Trend Forecast  
Freshpet remains a popular target in the high-growth pet sector short-term, but its current profit structure and lowered guidance clearly signal a "valuation convergence." If significant improvements in cost control are not demonstrated in Q2 and Q3, the market may reprice its valuation multiple, moving from a "growth stock premium" to "unprofitable consumer goods" territory. Investors should be wary of the valuation pullback risk due to unfulfilled profit expectations.
