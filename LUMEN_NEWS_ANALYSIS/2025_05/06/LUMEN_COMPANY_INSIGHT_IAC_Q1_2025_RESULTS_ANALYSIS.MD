1. Event Identification  
IAC (NASDAQ: IAC) released its Q1 2025 financial results, but the financial data for this quarter is not comparable to historical data and market expectations due to the completion of the Angi spinoff transaction on March 31. Key data includes:

- Revenue: $571 million vs market expectation of $809 million (38.6% year-over-year decline, falling short of the expected 29.5%)
- GAAP EPS: -$2.64 vs market expectation of -$2.03 (30.1% difference, significantly below expectations)
- Adjusted EBITDA: $50.9 million vs expectation of $19 million (profit margin of 8.9%, significantly exceeded)
- Full-year EBITDA guidance raised to $267.5 million (above the expected $251.1 million)
- Operating Margin: 6.3%, compared to -6.4% same period last year
- Free Cash Flow: -$4.6 million, compared to $48.34 million same period last year
- Current Market Value: $2.83 billion

2. Motivation Analysis  
Management restructured the financial reporting metrics after the Angi spinoff to clearly define the operational boundaries and profit model of the "new IAC." Emphasizing the EBITDA exceeding expectations and a significant positive shift in Operating Margin aims to convey the message that the company retains profit potential post-spinoff, thereby stabilizing investor confidence. The spinoff of Angi could also free up cash flow, providing resources for potential future acquisitions or organic platform growth.

3. Structural Perspective  
IAC is essentially a holding platform focused on incubating, operating, and spinning off internet companies. After the spinoff of Angi, its remaining asset portfolio (such as Dotdash Meredith, Care.com, etc.) primarily focuses on content, services, and vertical platforms. Current financial structure shows that although revenue has significantly declined, profitability indicators like EBITDA and Operating Margin have improved, indicating that remaining assets are more cost-effective. Additionally, negative cash flow reflects financial friction during short-term restructuring.

4. Key Variables  
- Impact of the spinoff transaction on taxes, one-time expenses, and amortization;  
- Recovery pace of advertising for remaining platforms (Dotdash Meredith, etc.);  
- Potential new investments or acquisitions entering a growth track;  
- Future capital strategy leaning towards self-operated vs. holding structure;  
- Clarity on the path to positive free cash flow.

5. Trend Prediction  
In the short term, IAC will continue to face pressure from valuation compression and structural reassessment. The market will focus on the independent profitability of the spinoff assets and new capital operations trends. If platforms like Dotdash can show resilience during the advertising market recovery in the second half of the year, there may be a chance to restore growth expectations by the latter half of 2025. Currently, the market pricing is close to asset底值, and if the company announces a new acquisition or spinoff, it could act as a catalyst for valuation. The medium-term trend is expected to be volatile, while the long-term performance will depend on capital allocation efficiency.
