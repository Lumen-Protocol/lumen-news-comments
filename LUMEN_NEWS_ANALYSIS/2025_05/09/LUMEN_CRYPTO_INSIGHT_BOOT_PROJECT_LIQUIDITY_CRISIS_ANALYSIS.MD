2. Motivation Analysis

From the on-chain trading behavior:
1. Quick liquidation and loss-cutting: Major wallets completed transactions in a short time while being in significant loss, indicating low confidence in the project.
2. Stop-loss escape: Losses of -89.74%, -70.54%, and -35.17% show rapid capital withdrawal to avoid further losses.
3. Low capital concentration: Large sums are not consolidated, and quick liquidations indicate market panic.

---

3. Structural Perspective

From the perspective of LUMEN structure analysis:
• Rapid capital withdrawal: All major wallets synchronously completed liquidation in a short period, indicating a significant liquidity crisis.
• Liquidity exhaustion risk: With a market cap of only $16.51K, the project can hardly withstand major sell-off pressure without new liquidity.
• Stop-loss after arbitrage failure: High-frequency trading did not yield expected returns and instead exacerbated market price decline.

---

4. Key Variables
• Subsequent capital flow: New capital injection could alleviate liquidity issues; otherwise, project prices will continue to fall.
• Presence of major returns: Currently, all major wallets are liquidated; without new institutional capital participation, prices will continue to decline.
• Liquidity pool monitoring: Once liquidity is depleted, the market may enter a liquidity death spiral.

---

5. Trend Prediction
1. Continued short-term decline: All major participants have exited, and market confidence is extremely weak.
2. Significant liquidity risk: With a market cap of only $16.51K, any sell-off will cause severe price fluctuations.
3. Potential zero-risk: The project may face a liquidity crisis without new large capital inflows.

LUMEN Structure Analysis

The BOOT project has exhibited significant capital flight in the short term, with all major wallets synchronously liquidating and all in large losses. This indicates that market confidence is near collapse, and the project is highly dependent on new capital inflows for survival. Without new liquidity injections, the project will face greater downward pressure and liquidity exhaustion risks. It is recommended to closely monitor subsequent on-chain capital movements, especially regarding new institutional participation.
