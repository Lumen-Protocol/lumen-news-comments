3. Structural Perspective  
BKNG shows a “cash flow-driven high-end platform” structure:  
- Core traffic engines drive revenue growth and improve profit structure;  
- Efficient cost control maintains stable gross margins;  
- Rapid free cash flow growth indicates a shift to “optimal cash conversion”;  
- Increased adjusted EBITDA is sourced from better pricing power and inventory control;  
- "Room nights booked" serves as a key operational indicator.

4. Key Variables  
(1) Macro factors and geopolitical risks on global travel;  
(2) Sustainability of pricing algorithms to enhance ADR;  
(3) Effectiveness of AI-driven systems for user LTV;  
(4) Growth in non-hotel offerings;  
(5) Continuity of free cash flow above 60% for buybacks or investments.

5. Trend Prediction  
BKNG is entering a "structural reinforcement phase," likely shifting to "cash flow-dominant" DCF re-evaluation. Its strong cash conversion and profit stability may command a valuation premium. If Q2 maintains current performance, the stock price could enter a new breakout area, appealing to risk-averse investors. Booking aims to become the “Adobe of travel,” stabilizing cash flow and enhancing features.

LUMEN Structure Summary  
Booking Holdings demonstrates a “mature structured platform”:  
- High synergy across platform modules;  
- Integrated profit and traffic functions ensure system stability;  
- Free cash flow leads resource allocation, forming a cycle of growth and valuation enhancement;  
- External macro risks exist, but the structure has hedging mechanisms.  
Booking has shifted from “platform expansion” to “cash flow structural reinforcement,” focusing on stability and actuarial ability, making it a valuable asset in volatile markets.
