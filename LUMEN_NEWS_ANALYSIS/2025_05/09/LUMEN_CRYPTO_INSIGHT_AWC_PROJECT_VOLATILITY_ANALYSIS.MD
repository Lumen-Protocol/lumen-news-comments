3. Structural Perspective

From the perspective of LUMEN structural analysis:
   • Rapid capital flow: Under high-risk markers, main wallets tend to enter and exit quickly, with low trading frequency.
   • Liquidation vs. holding game: evmsmart110 and evmsmart93 have completed liquidation, but evmsmart105 continues to hold, creating short-term market uncertainty.
   • Liquidity risks: Overall trading volume is only $99.14; large sell-offs could significantly amplify market price fluctuations.

4. Key Variables
   • Subsequent actions of evmsmart105: Whether to continue holding or liquidate will directly impact the short-term market.
   • Incoming capital situation: Without new buy orders, market price support will be weaker.
   • Changes in on-chain trading frequency: More Smart Traders joining will affect market liquidity.

5. Trend Forecast
   1. High volatility risk in the short term: Currently low trading volume and weak liquidity from large holders make violent fluctuations likely.
   2. Weak price support: The position of evmsmart105 is the only short-term support; its sell-off will further lower prices.
   3. Market sentiment is cautious: Most major players are choosing to liquidate, showing a clear lack of bullish momentum in the short term.

LUMEN Structural Analysis

The AWC project currently exhibits significant high-risk volatility characteristics, with rapid capital movement and a low holding-to-waiting ratio. The existing liquidity level cannot withstand large sell-off shocks, and attention should be paid to on-chain trading flows and the subsequent actions of evmsmart105. If the market fails to attract new capital, the risk of a correction will increase further.
