2. Motivation Analysis  
Singapore aims to alleviate additional cost pressures faced by its pharmaceutical industry in the U.S. market through segmented negotiations, maximizing localized benefits while maintaining competitiveness and market share amidst unchanging overall conditions. This approach seeks to prevent high tariffs from further impacting the nation's high-value manufacturing sector.

3. Structural Perspective  
Singapore's negotiation stance reflects a strategic adaptation of small open economies in the face of harsh U.S. trade policies: maintaining stability in overall political and economic relations without public confrontation, while actively seeking localized concessions through pragmatism and finely tuned negotiations to protect key industry exports. Meanwhile, the U.S. tariff system shows characteristics of "baseline locking + minor adjustment trading," offering no large-scale exceptions to allied economies.

4. Key Variables  
- U.S. assessment of Singapore's pharmaceutical sector's position and strategic value in the supply chain.  
- Possibility of technical compromise on specific drug categories or tariff quotas in negotiations.  
- Singapore's ability to unite other affected countries (like Ireland and Switzerland) to create micro-multilateral pressure.  
- Domestic political sensitivity in the U.S. regarding risks of rising drug prices.  
- Impact of global pharmaceutical supply chain restructuring trends on Singapore's export position.

5. Trend Forecast  
In the short term, Singapore may gain certain exemptions or conveniences in specific high-end pharmaceutical fields, but the overall 10% tariff framework will remain. In the medium term, similar small nations will face continued fragmentation pressures in export structures, prompting them to diversify markets and reduce dependency on U.S. exports; the U.S. will reinforce principles of supply chain security, with tariffs becoming a long-term structural tool.

LUMEN Structure Summary  
Singapore's negotiations on pharmaceutical exports to the U.S. illustrate that under the current global structural trade tensions, small and medium-sized open economies are increasingly shifting towards “nested games” focused on micro-projects, localized interests, and low-confrontation stances. This model suggests that the future international trade system will become more fragmented, with localized rule negotiations replacing macro-unified frameworks as the mainstream operational logic.
