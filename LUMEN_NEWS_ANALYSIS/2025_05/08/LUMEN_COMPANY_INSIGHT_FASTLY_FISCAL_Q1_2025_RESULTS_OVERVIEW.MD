2. Motivation Analysis

Fastly achieved an 8.2% revenue growth, surpassing market expectations by 4.8%. Though adjusted EPS remains negative, it showed improvement. Adjusted EBITDA grew over 50%, indicating optimization in cost control and margins. The most significant improvement was in free cash flow, rising from -$7.91 million to $8.21 million, reflecting better cash management and revenue collection speed. However, the drop in net revenue retention rate from 104% to 100% indicates pressure on customer expansion and retention.

3. Structural Perspective

Fastly's business model is primarily based on edge computing and content delivery networks (CDN), with its core competitiveness in fast, low-latency data delivery. The revenue growth and EBITDA improvement indicate stable market demand and enhanced service efficiency. Nonetheless, the negative operating margin suggests that despite revenue growth, the cost structure has not been fully optimized. The customer count reached 3,035, but the declining retention rate may signal challenges in contract renewals or expansions.

4. Key Variables
   • Demand for content delivery and edge computing: Growth in video streaming and real-time data processing will directly impact revenue.
   • Improvement in operational efficiency: The operating margin of -26.4% remains low; optimizing the cost structure will determine future profitability.
   • Customer retention and expansion: The decline in net revenue retention rate raises concerns about improving customer expansion rates.
   • Capital management and cash flow optimization: Positive free cash flow this quarter is promising; sustaining stable growth will impact expansion plans.

5. Trend Forecast

If Fastly can continue to improve its market share in edge computing and CDN, optimize operational efficiency, and restore customer retention rates, its EBITDA and free cash flow are likely to see healthy growth in the coming quarters. However, the ongoing negative operating margin and intensifying market competition could further squeeze profit margins. The focus should be on enhancing market penetration, increasing customer loyalty, and optimizing cost structures. Achieving this could transition Fastly from a "cash-burning expansion" model to a "stable profitability" one.

Analysis from LUMEN's Perspective

Fastly's report shows stable revenue growth and significantly improved free cash flow. From LUMEN's viewpoint, the company has a competitive edge in content delivery and edge computing. Structural analysis indicates that despite impressive revenue and EBITDA performance, the ongoing operating margin losses highlight the need for cost structure optimization. The decline in net revenue retention rate exposes difficulties in customer expansion and maintenance. Future efforts should focus on optimizing cost management, improving customer retention, and accelerating market penetration in edge computing to drive the company into a phase of higher-quality growth.
