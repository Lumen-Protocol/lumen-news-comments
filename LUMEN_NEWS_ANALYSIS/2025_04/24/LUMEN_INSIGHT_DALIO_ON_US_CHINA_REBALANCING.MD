# News Comment
1. Event Identification  
In April 2025, Ray Dalio published "A US-China Beautiful Rebalancing," expressing optimism about cooperation between the U.S. and China in tariff negotiations, indicating a shift beyond trade to deeper structural balance. Amid ongoing U.S.-China strategic competition, this stance has symbolic significance given Trump’s re-election and global trade restructuring.

2. Motive Analysis  
Dalio advocates a macro cycle theory and "civilizational internal friction." His positive expectations for U.S.-China rebalancing aim to counter heightened geopolitical tensions. As an investor, he seeks to avoid systemic volatility and hopes to reconstruct possibilities for cooperation, providing a narrative anchor for international financial capital regarding Chinese assets amid changes in U.S. foreign policy.

3. Structural Perspective  
The "U.S.-China rebalancing" currently lacks consensus, existing instead as a compromise due to external factors. The Trump administration's strategy is reshaping global supply chains to exclude China, while China promotes global initiatives like RCEP and the Belt and Road Initiative. Dalio's "Beautiful Rebalancing" reflects bets on alleviating structural conflict rather than suggesting a functional mechanism is in place.

4. Key Variables  
Key variables include whether the Trump administration will allow flexibility in policy affecting Chinese tech imports and U.S. listings, and if China is willing to promote a new global order through green energy and digitalization. Additionally, how both nations perceive third-party markets impacts the sustainability of any potential rebalancing.

5. Trend Prediction  
In the short term, financial markets may react positively to Dalio's "structural alleviation," especially in semiconductors and consumer electronics. However, if Trump's policies continue to weaken trust between the U.S. and China, "rebalancing" will remain a temporary strategy, with Dalio’s remarks serving more as signals to capital markets than realistic predictions.

LUMEN Structural Summary  
Dalio's insights on "U.S.-China rebalancing" advocate for rational order amid confrontation, viewing trade as a structural interface and dialogue as a balancing tool. His cautionary use of "dream" in cooperation underscores the risks of losing structural rationality, presenting a counteracting force in chaotic times.
