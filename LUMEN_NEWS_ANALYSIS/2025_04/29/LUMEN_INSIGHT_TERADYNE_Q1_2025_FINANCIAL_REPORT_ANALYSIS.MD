3. Structural Insight  
- Revenue Structure: Quarterly revenue reached $685.7 million, up 14.3% year-on-year, aligning with market consensus expectations, primarily driven by the system-on-chip (SoC) testing business, particularly in mobile devices.  
- Profitability: Adjusted EPS was $0.75, significantly above the expected $0.62 (21.8% higher), with operating profit margin increasing from 13% to 17.6%, demonstrating strong operational leverage.  
- Cash Flow Recovery: Free cash flow rebounded to $97.62 million, improving from negative the previous year, reflecting better operational efficiency and cash recovery.  
- Inventory Structure Changes: Inventory days increased from 88 to 116, indicating some finished goods backlog, necessitating continued attention to the pace of inventory reduction.  
- Future Guidance: Q2 revenue guidance is $645 million, and EPS guidance is $0.53, both in line with market expectations, reflecting management's cautiously optimistic view on demand recovery.

4. Key Variables  
- Downstream Semiconductor Demand: Mobile SoC is the current growth driver; a slowdown in smartphone upgrade cycles could directly impact performance in the second half.  
- Inventory Adjustment Cycle: An increase in inventory days may signal a slowdown in short-term shipping pace; failure to reduce inventory timely could compress future profit margins.  
- Capital Expenditure (CapEx): Whether clients expand testing equipment investments will determine the sustainability of Teradyne's order momentum.  
- Exchange Rate and Supply Chain Fluctuations: A strong dollar or component supply chain bottlenecks remain potential uncertainties.

5. Trend Forecast  
In the short term (1-2 quarters), Teradyne is expected to maintain steady growth, benefiting from a rebound in semiconductor testing demand, and restoring free cash flow will strengthen its capital structure and support valuation. In the medium term (6-12 months), if inventory digestion proceeds smoothly and mobile SoC demand remains stable, there is potential for upward revisions in full-year profit guidance. However, risks need to be managed if the recovery in consumer electronics like smartphones and PCs falls short of expectations, potentially leading to inventory pressure and weakened order momentum. Overall, this period is critical for confirming structural recovery.

LUMEN Structural Summary:  
Teradyne currently exhibits a typical structure of demand recovery—profit elasticity release—inventory management challenges: demand recovery drives revenue and profit above expectations, operationally demonstrating improved cash flow and profit margin; however, rising inventory and uncertainty in terminal demand pose potential drawbacks. The company enters a phase dominated by cash flow recovery and validation of order sustainability, with upcoming quarters crucial for determining whether trends will consolidate or correct.
