2. Motivation Analysis
   1. Short-term arbitrage failure: The rapid liquidation by solsmart3 and solsmart32 after buying indicates a failed expectation for short-term market gains.
   2. High-risk holding: solsmart73 continues to hold despite significant market corrections, showing higher risk tolerance or expectation for future rebound.
   3. Insufficient liquidity: Overall low trading volume means increased selling pressure could lead to drastic price fluctuations.

3. Structural Insight

From the LUMEN structural analysis perspective:
   • Major players are exiting: The quick liquidation by solsmart3 and solsmart32 reflects a negative outlook on short-term trends.
   • High-risk holders' gamble: solsmart73 remains in position but faces significant losses; continued decline may result in forced liquidation.
   • Liquidity dilemma: Current low trading volume means new selling pressure could cause rapid decline.

---

4. Key Variables
   • Decision of solsmart73: If it continues to hold and adds to its position, it might trigger a short-term rebound; cutting losses could lead to new selling pressure.
   • Market depth improvement: Without new capital inflow, market liquidity will worsen, causing further declines.
   • Involvement of potential buyers: New capital entering the market will be crucial to changing the current downward trend.

5. Trend Prediction
   1. Short-term downside risk: Major funds have withdrawn; if solsmart73 continues to cut losses, prices will further decline.
   2. High volatility: Lack of liquidity means large trades could cause drastic fluctuations, making it suitable for high-risk arbitrage in the short term.
   3. New capital determines rebound: Significant capital injection within the next 24 hours might offer a chance for market rebound; otherwise, it will remain under pressure.

LUMEN Structural Analysis

The Rudy project currently exhibits high-risk speculative characteristics, with major funds quickly exiting and leaving a few high-risk holders. The market is severely lacking in liquidity; if solsmart73 liquidates, prices could plummet further. Only new buyers can potentially change the current downward trend. It is advisable to monitor large fund flows on-chain and the next move from solsmart73.
