1. Event Identification  
Mondelez (NASDAQ: MDLZ) released its Q1 2025 financial report, showing flat overall revenue but a significant decline in profit margins, highlighting severe erosion of profitability due to cost pressures. Key data includes: revenue of $9.31 billion, in line with market expectations; adjusted EPS of $0.74, exceeding expectations by 12.2%; however, adjusted EBITDA was only $1 billion, far below the market expectation of $1.54 billion, a miss of 34.7%. Operating profit margin plummeted from 29.4% to 7.3%, and free cash flow margin dropped to 8.8%. Organic revenue grew 3.1% year-over-year, but sales declined by 3.5%. The company currently has a market capitalization of approximately $84.3 billion.

2. Motivation Analysis  
Faced with high raw material costs (especially cocoa) and weak consumer demand, the company has raised product prices to stabilize revenue, but this has led to a continuous decline in sales. Its short-term motivation is to maintain revenue stability and manage market expectations; in the long term, it aims to leverage brand influence to increase unit value, though it has not yet effectively translated this into profit recovery.

3. Structural Perspective  
Mondelez demonstrates a typical structural contradiction of "raising prices to maintain revenue while profits are squeezed." Although revenue remains stable, the significant drop in EBITDA shows that the price increase strategy has not fully covered the cost impacts, particularly in the context of high inflation affecting raw material and transportation costs. The popular categories in its product mix are highly price-sensitive, resulting in a scenario of double losses in price and sales; structural leverage effects are failing, leading to a contraction in profit margins.

4. Key Variables  
- Fluctuations in the prices of cocoa and sugar will directly affect future profit elasticity.  
- Consumers' tolerance for continuous price increases will determine whether organic growth can be sustained.  
- The brandâ€™s ability to fend off similar substitutes.  
- The speed of cost structure optimization and supply chain synergy improvements.

5. Trend Forecast  
If raw material prices remain high and the company continues to stabilize income through price increases, sales declines will intensify, leading to further deterioration of profitability. In the medium term, Mondelez may need to rely on layoffs, SKU reductions, and operational cost cuts to restore EBITDA elasticity. While structural imbalances remain unresolved, valuations will increasingly depend on cash flow stability rather than growth potential.

LUMEN Structural Summary:  
Mondelez is in a period of structural compression: rising cost rigidity on the input side and revenue-side pricing limits are creating a counter-structural tension of "stable income - profit loss." Its business model is shifting from "strong brands driving profitability" to "strong brands delaying decline," and valuation will be re-priced based on low growth, high brand strength, but weak profit elasticity.
