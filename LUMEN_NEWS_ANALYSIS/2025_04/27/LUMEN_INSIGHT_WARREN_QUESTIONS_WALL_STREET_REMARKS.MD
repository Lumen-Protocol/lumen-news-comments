2. Motivation Analysis  
- Warren's Motivation: To further her long-standing stance on enhanced financial regulation, using public pressure to shape her image as a "defender of financial regulation" and expand political mobilization among the dissatisfied public regarding the Wall Street system.  
- Bessent's Motivation: As a heavyweight in the financial industry, he may have expressed criticisms or dissatisfaction with the current regulatory environment, economic policies, or political dynamics in a closed setting, reflecting anxiety within the industry over policy direction.  
- Media Motivation: By amplifying conflicts between politics and business, the media creates public discourse while hinting at potential tensions between the financial sector and Washington, increasing the sensitivity of the topic.

3. Structural Perspective  
- Tightened Political-Business Interaction: In an environment of high interest rates, de-globalization, and intensified regulation, the traditional mechanisms for coordinating interests between Wall Street and Washington are under pressure, leading to more signs of public conflict.  
- Reshaping Public Opinion Structure: The left within the Democratic Party, represented by Warren, is framing "anti-Wall Street elites" as a core narrative for remobilizing voters.  
- Active Subtle Game Structure: Private closed-door remarks are increasingly leaking into public spaces, reflecting rising pressures for information transparency, while internal disagreements manifest as public opinion events, prompting capital and political elites to adjust their strategies.

4. Key Variables  
- Details of Bessent's remarks and the method of their leakage;  
- Whether Warren and her allies will push for hearings, investigations, or legislative proposals;  
- The financial industry's genuine response and collective strategies regarding current or proposed financial regulatory policies;  
- Changes in the weight of financial regulatory issues within the Democratic Party for the 2025 elections;  
- The extent to which mainstream and social media amplify the event and shape public opinion.

5. Trend Forecast  
- Warren and her allies may seize this opportunity to strengthen public attacks on the financial industry, promoting stricter disclosure and moral hazard limitation measures;  
- Executives in the financial industry will further tighten risk management of their statements in public and private settings to avoid inadvertently sparking political storms;  
- A new round of legislative initiatives focusing on "financial system transparency and accountability" may emerge, particularly concerning large banks, hedge funds, and wealth management firms;  
- In the medium to long term, the "public cooperation, private opposition" model between Wall Street and Washington may be further disrupted, moving towards greater public confrontation or strategic concessions.

LUMEN Structural Summary  
Warren's questioning of Bessent's remarks is not just an isolated political pressure tactic but rather a reflection of the accelerating changes in the financial power structure leading to 2025. Essentially, it is:  
- A microcosmic representation of the reconfiguration of state power over capital power;  
- An erosion of the traditional political-business tacit agreement by new public opinion mechanisms;  
- A prelude to the exposure of internal institutional tensions in the U.S. amidst the global trend of de-financialization.  
In the future, the U.S. financial industry will have to reshape its legitimacy and survival logic under higher transparency and stronger political intervention. Warren represents not just a coincidental political move, but a structural, long-term wave of institutional pressure.
