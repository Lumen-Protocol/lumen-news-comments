1. Event Identification  
Mondelez (NASDAQ: MDLZ) reported its Q1 2025 financial results, showing flat overall revenue but a significant decline in profit margins, highlighting the severe erosion of profitability due to cost pressures. Key figures include: revenue of $9.31 billion, meeting market expectations; adjusted EPS of $0.74, exceeding expectations by 12.2%; however, adjusted EBITDA was only $1 billion, far below the expected $1.54 billion, missing by 34.7%. Operating profit margin plummeted from 29.4% to 7.3%, and free cash flow profit margin decreased to 8.8%. Organic revenue grew by 3.1% year-on-year, but sales volume declined by 3.5%. The company currently has a market capitalization of approximately $84.3 billion.

2. Motivation Analysis  
Confronted with high raw material costs (especially cocoa) and weak consumer demand, the company has raised product prices to stabilize revenue, but this move has led to continuous sales decline. Its short-term motivation is to ensure revenue remains intact and maintain credibility in the capital market; longer-term, it aims to leverage brand influence to increase unit value, but has yet to effectively convert this into profit recovery.

3. Structural Perspective  
Mondelez exhibits a typical structural contradiction of "price increases to maintain revenue while profits are squeezed." Despite maintaining revenue, the significant drop in EBITDA indicates that the price increase strategy has not fully covered cost impacts, especially on raw materials and transportation in a high-inflation environment. The mass-market segments in its product mix are highly sensitive to price changes, resulting in a win-lose situation for price and volume; structural leverage effects have failed, leading to a compression of profit margins.

4. Key Variables  
- Fluctuations in cocoa and sugar raw material prices will directly affect future profit elasticity;  
- Consumers' tolerance for continuous price increases will determine the sustainability of organic growth;  
- The brand's ability to fend off substitute products;  
- The speed of cost structure optimization and improvement in supply chain collaboration capabilities.

5. Trend Forecast  
If raw material prices remain high, and the company continues to rely on price increases to stabilize revenue, further declines in sales volume will exacerbate profitability issues. In the medium term, Mondelez may need to rely on layoffs, SKU rationalization, and reducing operational expenses to restore EBITDA elasticity. Until the structural imbalance is resolved, its valuation will depend more on cash flow stability rather than growth potential.

LUMEN Structural Summary:  
Mondelez is undergoing a period of structural compression: rising rigidity on the cost side and an income side nearing price increase limits leads to a counter-structural tension of "stable incomeâ€”profit loss." Its business model is shifting from "strong brand driving profitability" to "strong brand delaying decline," resulting in a revaluation logic centered around low growth, high brand strength, but weak profit elasticity.
