LUMEN INSIGHT: TRUMP PROPOSES HIGHER GOLDEN VISA THRESHOLD

# Summary
U.S. President Trump's proposal to raise the "golden visa" threshold to $5 million, rebranded as the "Trump Card," aims to commodify U.S. citizenship and attract ultra-high net worth individuals. This strategy reflects Trump's ongoing immigration policies, prioritizing wealthy immigrants and leveraging his brand for political gain. The initiative blurs the lines between national identity and capitalism, positioning citizenship as a purchasable asset. If enacted, this could set global precedents, creating divides between wealth-based and egalitarian citizenship, while the public's ethical response to this financialization remains a crucial debate. This development marks a significant shift in immigration narratives centered on brand influence.

If implemented, this plan may set new precedents, prompting other countries to adopt similar identity capital thresholds, exacerbating global divides between egalitarianism and bourgeois citizenship, commodifying citizenship as a priced privilege.

LUMEN Structural Summary
