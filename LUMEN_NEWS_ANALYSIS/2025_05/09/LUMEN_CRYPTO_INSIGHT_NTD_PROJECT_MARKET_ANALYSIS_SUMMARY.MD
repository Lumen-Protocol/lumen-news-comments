2. Motivation Analysis

From the on-chain trading behavior:
1. Significant short-term arbitrage: solsmart32 quickly executed 4 sells after 1 buy, achieving +86.44% ROI, demonstrating strong short-term volatility capture.
2. High-frequency selling: smartsol1 executed 8 sells with an ROI of -5.41%, indicating rapid selling during price corrections.
3. Concentrated selling pressure causing declines: The high-frequency selling by solsmart74 and smartsol1 created noticeable selling pressure in the market.

3. Structural Perspective

From the LUMEN structural analysis perspective:
- High short-term capital concentration: Most trading is concentrated in solsmart32, solsmart74, and smartsol1, which rapidly buy and sell.
- Post-clearance selling pressure risk: The concentrated high-frequency selling exacerbated market liquidity pressure, leading to significant price declines.
- Arbitrage behavior dominates: solsmart32’s ROI is much higher than the other two traders, indicating that market capital flow is more driven by short-term arbitrage than long-term investment.

4. Key Variables
- solsmart32's subsequent actions: Its decision to re-enter for high-frequency arbitrage will directly affect short-term market volatility.
- Market liquidity monitoring: Continued outflow of existing capital without new inflows may lead to further price declines.
- Changes in the capital pool: Whether the selling behavior of solsmart74 and smartsol1 sparks more follow-on selling.
- Short-term trading strategies: The actions of solsmart74 and smartsol1 will be crucial for short-term market liquidity.

5. Trend Forecast
1. Further declines may continue in the short term: The selling pressure from high-frequency liquidation has not been fully digested, posing further downward risks.
2. Arbitrage-driven volatility amplification: solsmart32’s short-term arbitrage may attract more short-term traders, further amplifying volatility.
3. Monitoring liquidity pool depth: Continued capital outflow may subject NTD’s price to greater downward pressure.

LUMEN Structural Analysis

In the short term, the NTD project exhibits a typical pattern of high-frequency arbitrage and rapid selling, with most capital not remaining long-term but being quickly liquidated. Short-term trading dominates market direction, and in the absence of new capital inflows, price pressure will continue to escalate. Close attention should be paid to large on-chain transfers and changes in liquidity pools to prevent further declines that could trigger market panic.
