1. Event Identification  
Plexus (NASDAQ: PLXS) is a company that designs, manufactures, and services complex electronic products for customers in the aerospace/defense, healthcare, and industrial sectors. Current data shows the company is facing ongoing declines in sales, weak profit growth, and cash flow pressures.

2. Motivation Analysis  
Plexus's core motivation is to maintain revenue and profitability in its traditional strongholds but is pressured by a weak macro economy, industry cyclical downturns, and low internal capital operation efficiency. The company aims to address external challenges by optimizing its customer structure and project selection, but market trends are unfavorable.

3. Structural Perspective  
Plexus's business structure relies on highly customized and complex small-batch production orders, but sales have decreased by an average of 3.6% annually over the past two years, indicating a weakening market demand trend. Meanwhile, earnings per share (EPS) have grown only 1.7% annually, well below industry averages, reflecting inadequate cost control and scale effects. More critically, the free cash flow profit margin over the past five years has been merely 2.9%, indicating that Plexus's internal growth funds are nearly exhausted, leaving little room for buybacks, investments, or defensive capital operations.

4. Key Variables  
• Industry Demand Environment: Prolonged weakness in the global economy, especially with reduced capital expenditures in industrial, healthcare, and defense sectors, will continue to pressure Plexus's performance.  
• Customer Concentration and Project Risk: Heavy reliance on a few large clients increases sensitivity to order cancellations or pricing pressures.  
• Internal Efficiency Improvement Capability: Plexus needs to quickly enhance working capital turnover and production processes to free up more cash flow; otherwise, it will lose initiative in future investments, buybacks, or counter-cyclical measures.  
• Capital Market Valuation Pressure: The current forward P/E ratio of 17.4x, considering its cash flow performance and low growth potential, poses risks of stock price adjustments if profit growth does not improve.

5. Trend Prediction  
Without significant structural improvements, Plexus is expected to face slight declines in revenue and further slowdowns in profit growth. Limited capital expenditure will hinder its ability to capture emerging growth areas. Unless management can enhance cash flow efficiency and optimize customer structure, Plexus's valuation may be adjusted downward toward, or below, industry averages in the next 1-2 years.

LUMEN Structural Summary  
Plexus's issues reflect a saturation in traditionally strong markets, weak internal cash flow, sluggish profit growth, and a lack of valuation support. The logical chain is clear and coherent; unless there are breakthroughs in operations or market expansion, the weakening fundamentals are likely to continue over the next year.
