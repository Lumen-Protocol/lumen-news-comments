# News Comment
üß† 1. Event Identification  
The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury bond broke above 4.40% again on the morning of April 21, 2025, rising by 8 basis points, moving against historical trends and weakening alongside the dollar. This phenomenon was highlighted by economist Mohamed El-Erian, indicating that the traditional "strong dollar - falling Treasury" structure is being deconstructed.

üß≠ 2. Motivation Analysis  
‚Ä¢ The market believes that the fiscal deficit will continue to expand post-Trump's re-election, increasing supply risks for U.S. Treasuries.  
‚Ä¢ Although the Federal Reserve's policy path has not significantly turned hawkish, resilient inflation and geopolitical factors are raising risk premiums.  
‚Ä¢ Investors are undergoing a structural reassessment of ‚Äúthe safety of long-term U.S. Treasury assets,‚Äù reflecting a shift in capital allocation logic.  
‚Ä¢ Amid a weak dollar, overseas funds may actively avoid the duration risk of Treasuries outside of carry trade logic.  

üî¨ 3. Structural Perspective  

Variable | Traditional Logic | Current Reality  
--- | --- | ---  
Dollar Movement vs Treasury Yield | Dollar depreciation ‚Üí Treasury strengthens (safe haven) | Dollar depreciation + Treasury sell-off occur simultaneously  
Drivers of Treasury Yield | Inflation expectations / Fed interest rate path | Fiscal deficit, refinancing pressures, and the risk of de-dollarization by overseas investors  
Investor Allocation Logic | Treasuries seen as a "risk-free asset" | Treasuries viewed as "policy risk assets," requiring a risk premium  

üí• 4. Key Variables  
‚Ä¢ Whether the upcoming long-term Treasury auction yield exceeds market expectations.  
‚Ä¢ Whether the Federal Reserve signals "no more rate cuts" to stabilize the yield curve.  
‚Ä¢ Whether U.S. financial sanctions against China and Russia further trigger "sovereign capital flight."  
‚Ä¢ Any signals from major central banks (like Japan or Saudi Arabia) to reduce their Treasury holdings.  

üìà 5. Trend Forecast  
‚Ä¢ The Treasury market is pricing in an "era of structural deficits," rather than just a single inflation cycle.  
‚Ä¢ In the coming weeks, there may be a shift in investor allocations towards "short-term bonds + gold + energy stocks."  
‚Ä¢ If demand for Treasury auctions continues to weaken, the Fed may be forced to end balance sheet reduction early, becoming a marginal buyer again.  
‚Ä¢ The distortion in the yield curve will further exacerbate uncertainty for financial institutions' refinancing.  

üìê Structural Summary  
The Treasury yield's breach of 4.40% signifies the visible structural fissures in the U.S. fiscal-monetary system. In an era where the dollar credit system confronts geopolitical challenges, with an expanding deficit and waning safe-haven effectiveness, the 10-year Treasury no longer serves merely as an interest rate anchor but becomes a collective vote on the stability of the entire imperial structure. This is not a market error but a reflection of the market's loss of faith in the old formulas.
