üß© 1. Event Identification

In April 2025, Trump criticized Federal Reserve Chairman Powell on his channel, labeling him "too slow" and suggesting interest rates should have been lowered. He indicated that Powell should be dismissed, framing the Federal Reserve as an adversary in the 2025 election narrative.

‚∏ª

üîç 2. Motive Deconstruction

Trump's statements reveal three objectives:
1. Shifting Political Responsibility
Attributing inflation to Powell creates a scapegoat for economic issues.
2. Pressuring the Fed to Lower Rates
He aims to create an illusion of economic prosperity in a tight polling scenario.
3. Framing Monetary Policy as "Presidential Sovereignty"
By stating "Powell should be fired," Trump seeks to assert presidential control over monetary policy.

üß† 3. Structural Insight

This tweet highlights the deconstruction of the Federal Reserve's "neutrality myth":

Structural Dimension | Normal State | Trump‚Äôs Language State
--- | --- | ---
Interest Rate Path | Independent judgment | Presidential directives
Inflation Explanation | Multi-factor analysis | "I have tariffs, you messed up"
Monetary Power Perception | Technical governance | Emotional intervention
Fed's Role | Managing expectations | Tool in the political cycle

The core issue is not ‚Äúwhether to lower rates,‚Äù but **‚Äúcan monetary policy exist outside of political narratives?‚Äù**

‚∏ª

üí• 4. Key Variables

Five key variables will determine the structural impact of this attack:
1. Powell‚Äôs response to Trump's comments
2. Internal fractures or dovish statements within the Fed
3. Congressional attempts to restrict the Fed's authority
4. Capital markets pricing in risk premiums for political interference
5. International central banks expressing skepticism about the Fed's neutrality

‚∏ª

üìà 5. Trend Projection

Short-term (1-2 weeks): The Fed will likely remain silent, while markets speculate on ‚Äúpassive rate cuts‚Äù and Trump‚Äôs rhetoric escalates.

Mid-term (1-3 months): The Fed may lower rates if economic data deteriorates, but all decisions will be seen through a political lens.

Long-term (3-9 months): Presidential dominance in monetary policy could become the norm, prompting global alternatives to the dollar.

üéØ LUMEN Summary

This tweet signifies a linguistic invasion of monetary governance:

‚Ä¢ Powell symbolizes "institutional neutrality" being deconstructed;
‚Ä¢ Trump aims to redefine power boundaries, not just control rates;
‚Ä¢ The Fed‚Äôs silence indicates passivity, while a response would signal a structural confrontation.

When the president can dictate interest rates and currency becomes an electoral tool, the dollar loses its structural significance and turns into a mere emotional wave.
