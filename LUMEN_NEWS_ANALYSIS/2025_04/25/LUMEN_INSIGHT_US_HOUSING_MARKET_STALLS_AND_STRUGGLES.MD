LUMEN INSIGHT: US HOUSING MARKET STALLS AND STRUGGLES

# Summary
The U.S. housing market is currently experiencing a significant stall as homeowners struggle to sell amid rising listings and declining transaction volumes. High mortgage rates above 6.5% have created financial pressures for buyers, particularly first-time homebuyers, while sellers are reluctant to part with properties due to favorable existing loan rates. This situation reflects a structural cooling rather than a temporary imbalance, driven by factors including high home purchase costs, regional disparities, and a disconnect between new and existing home markets. Predictions suggest a transition to a buyer's market, with potential price reductions, changes in buyer focus, and emerging opportunities for innovative real estate solutions.

# News Comment
1. Event Identification

On April 25, 2025, MarketWatch reported that the U.S. housing market is stalling, with many homeowners struggling to sell. Although the number of listings is rising, transaction volume continues to decline as buyers remain hesitant, leading to a stalemate in prices and frozen transactions.

2. Motivation Analysis

The difficulties in home sales reflect a misalignment of expectations between buyers and sellers, compounded by macroeconomic pressures:
- On the buyer side: High financing costs. Current mortgage rates remain above 6.5%, placing significant monthly payment pressures on buyers, particularly first-time homebuyers who cannot enter the market.
- On the seller side: A strong reluctance to sell. Most homeowners hold loans with rates below 3% and are unwilling to bear the costs of “selling low and buying high” during the transition.
- Uncertainty in the economic and employment outlook makes residents hesitant to take on higher leverage, with housing no longer seen as a growth asset but rather a reflection of structural liquidity challenges.

3. Structural Perspective

The "stalling of the housing market" is not a short-term supply-demand imbalance but a structural cooling driven by five system tensions:
1. Sustained high mortgage rates have broken the decades-long “low rates – high transactions” trading inertia.
2. Home prices have not significantly decreased, keeping the “home purchase cost – income ratio” at a historical high, stalling demand.
3. Homeowners' willingness to sell is limited by the “negative refinancing effect,” as the interest rate gap makes existing loans a “lock-in mechanism.”
4. A disconnection between the new home market and the existing home market, with developers lowering prices to capture first-time buyer markets, while existing homes suffer from insufficient renovations and transaction friction.
5. Regional disparities are widening, with high-outflow areas, like some cities in California, seeing almost no transactions, whereas inflow hotspots like Texas and Florida still experience structural demand but face supply shortages.

4. Key Variables
- Whether mortgage rates can fall below 5.5% in the second half of 2025, boosting credit accessibility;
- The introduction of mortgage tax incentives or first-time homebuyer subsidies to stimulate demand;
- Whether regional markets will enter a new phase of “active price reductions – quick transactions,” breaking the national price stalemate;
- Whether inflation and employment data will affect the Federal Reserve's stance, indirectly determining the trend of mortgage liquidity tightening or easing.

5. Trend Prediction

The current state of the U.S. housing market has transitioned from “slow decline” to a “transaction freeze critical point.” The following evolution path is expected:
- Listing volumes will increase further, but transaction cycles will extend, and bargaining space will widen, forming an initial buyer's market structure;
- Homeowners will be forced to accept the reality that “2021 price peaks cannot be returned,” leading to increased willingness to lower prices, with some markets seeing declines exceeding 10%;
- Buyers will focus on areas with high commuting potential, low tax burdens, and high rental returns, leading to a trend of “functional transaction concentration”;
- Brokerage platforms and PropTech companies will face transformative opportunities, providing innovative services such as “high liquidity home swaps, guaranteed loans, and shared payment models” to fill structural effectiveness gaps.

Conclusion: The housing market's issues extend beyond unsold houses; they represent a convergence of dysfunctions in household asset allocation, income expectation mechanisms, and monetary cycle models. It is becoming a “static alarm” for the whole economy's liquidity. The quietness signals a loss of speed.
