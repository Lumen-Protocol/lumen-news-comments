2. Motivation Analysis
   1. Short-term high-risk arbitrage: The quick liquidation of solsmart3 and solsmart18 with large losses indicates a swift exit after failed short-term speculation.
   2. Minimal profit-taking strategy: @xiaomaoge realized a 10.11% profit and immediately liquidated, demonstrating a more cautious arbitrage approach.
   3. Extreme market fragility: With a volume of only $383.28, liquidity is very low, resulting in minimal costs for market manipulation and significant volatility risks.

3. Structural Perspective

From a LUMEN structural analysis perspective:
   • Weak capital flow: Extremely low market liquidity means that individual buy or sell orders can trigger significant volatility.
   • Short-term arbitrage failure: The losses from solsmart3 and solsmart18 reflect insufficient market liquidity making short-term arbitrage extremely challenging.
   • Absence of market leaders: There is no visible ongoing capital injection on-chain, making it difficult to support a price rebound in the short term.

---

4. Key Variables
   • New capital involvement: Without new significant purchases, price support will be difficult, potentially leading to further market downturns.
   • Changes in on-chain liquidity pools: Insufficient liquidity could amplify market volatility, with slight selling pressure leading to sudden crashes.
   • Return of major wallets: If solsmart3 or solsmart18 re-enter, it could signal whether the market is poised for a rebound.

5. Trend Forecast
   1. Severe volatility in the short term: Low liquidity makes the market highly susceptible to large trades, with potential for further declines.
   2. Potential downward pressure: Without new capital inflow, the market may continue to test bottoms, increasing the pullback risk for existing holders.
   3. Possibility of slight rebounds: @xiaomaoge's small profit-taking shows that minor capital inflows could lead to brief market recoveries, but sustainability is unlikely.

LUMEN Structural Analysis

The Act: Meme project exhibits extreme volatility and fragile market liquidity, where a small number of buy or sell orders can significantly impact prices. Major capital has largely exited, leaving only minimal short-term arbitragers. Without new and sustained inflows, a downward trend is likely, and the market faces risks of deeper declines. Close attention should be given to changes in on-chain liquidity and signals for new capital involvement.
