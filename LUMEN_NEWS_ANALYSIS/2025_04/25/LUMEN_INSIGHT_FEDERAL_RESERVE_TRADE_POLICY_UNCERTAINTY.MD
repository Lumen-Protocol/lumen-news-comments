LUMEN INSIGHT: FEDERAL RESERVE TRADE POLICY UNCERTAINTY

# Summary
On April 24, 2025, the Federal Reserve's Beige Book highlighted that trade friction and ambiguity are significantly suppressing economic activity and investment. It identified trade policy uncertainty as a major macroeconomic variable influencing policy decisions. The Fed's motivations include integrating trade factors into monetary policy and addressing structural uncertainties that impact economic confidence at multiple levels. In the upcoming months, a lack of clear trade policy could lead businesses to adopt a defensive stance, dampening consumer expectations and complicating monetary strategies. The Beige Book emphasizes the necessity for institutional clarity to avoid a potential "behavioral pause" in the economy.

1. Event Identification

On April 24, 2025, the Federal Reserve's "Beige Book" indicated that trade friction and policy uncertainty are creating "pervasive uncertainty," suppressing economic activity and investment. This suggests that trade policy ambiguity is now a core macroeconomic variable.

2. Motivation Analysis

The Beige Book focuses on "trade friction" and "pervasive uncertainty" with several motivations:
- The Fed aims to use trade factors as monetary policy variables to allow for future easing.
- It seeks to lower market optimism regarding economic recovery to prevent excessive corporate investment and mitigate inflation.
- It indicates the need for fiscal and diplomatic coordination alongside monetary policy.
- It warns the administration that structural uncertainty requires institutional responses.

3. Structural Perspective

"Trade uncertainty leads to a decline in economic confidence," reflecting five structural levels:
1. Unclear policy → Delayed investment;
2. Unbalanced supply chains → Confused inventory strategies;
3. Fluctuating costs → Disrupted profit models;
4. Credit issues among small businesses → Job and income pressures;
5. Contraction of expectations → Eroded consumer confidence.

An unclear tariff curve can push the market into a "wait-and-see mode."

4. Key Variables

5. Trend Forecast

In the next 3-6 months, if trade policy remains in "rhetorical control," the U.S. economy may enter a "structurally ineffective signal zone":
- Businesses may move from "strategic pause" to "long-term defense," reducing capital expenditure;
- Consumer expectations may decline, complicating the Fed's reliance on inflation indicators;
- The administration may need to introduce executable trade frameworks;
- Investors may see U.S. dollar assets as "risk assets constrained by politics."

LUMEN Structural Summary

The Beige Book signals that without institutional clarity, even a strong economy can enter a "behavioral pause." "Pervasive uncertainty" signals a systemic logic failure, highlighting that the economy cannot rely solely on rhetoric; institutions drive behavior. This is the true LUMEN signal behind the Beige Book.
