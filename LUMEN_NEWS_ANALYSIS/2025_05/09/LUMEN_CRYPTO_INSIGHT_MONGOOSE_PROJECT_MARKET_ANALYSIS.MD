2. Motivation Analysis
   1. Short-term arbitrage failure: Rapid buy and liquidation by solsmart73 and solsmart30 resulted in losses, indicating a misjudgment of short-term fluctuations.
   2. Aggressive high-return strategy: solsmart56 realized a +178.27% ROI upon liquidation, showing a precise capture of selling points amid price fluctuations.
   3. Poor market liquidity: Overall trading volume of $14K indicates very limited liquidity, with short-term fluctuations likely to be amplified.

3. Structural Perspective

From the perspective of LUMEN structure analysis:
   • Funds quickly withdrawn: Major wallets completed liquidation rapidly in two days, indicating a lack of long-term holding confidence in the market.
   • Insufficient market liquidity: $14K in trading volume cannot support large buy/sell operations; increased selling pressure may lead to larger declines.
   • High returns from a single wallet: The significant returns from solsmart56 show that short-term fluctuations within the project can have a substantial impact with minimal funds.

---

4. Key Variables
   • Secondary market capital flow: The entry of new buying power will determine the project's viability.
   • solsmart56's actions: As the only profitable wallet, its decision to re-enter will signal market trends.
   • Overall liquidity improvement: With current liquidity low, if trading volume does not increase in the next 24 hours, the market will remain sluggish.

---

5. Trend Predictions
   1. Limited chance of significant short-term rebound: Current market liquidity is insufficient, and with major players liquidating, upward momentum is restricted.
   2. Potential selling pressure risk: If solsmart56 chooses to rebuild positions, it may attract additional arbitrage funds; otherwise, the market will continue to weaken.
   3. Risk of weak liquidity: Current trading volume is far below healthy levels; new capital inflow is crucial for stability.

LUMEN Structure Analysis

The MONGOOSE project exhibits characteristics of rapid short-term fund withdrawal and high-return arbitrage, particularly represented by solsmart56's actions. In a context of overall insufficient liquidity, small fund fluctuations can lead to larger price changes. The entry of new funds will be key to the project's rebound; otherwise, it will continue to face selling pressure. It is advised to monitor on-chain trading trends and substantial transfer activities.
