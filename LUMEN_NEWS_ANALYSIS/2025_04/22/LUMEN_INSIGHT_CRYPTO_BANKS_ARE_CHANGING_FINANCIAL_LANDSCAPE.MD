LUMEN INSIGHT: CRYPTO BANKS ARE CHANGING FINANCIAL LANDSCAPE

# Summary
Cryptocurrency companies like Coinbase, Circle, BitGo, and Paxos are seeking U.S. banking licenses, signaling a shift towards "compliant crypto banks" that integrate into the traditional banking system. Their goal is to provide comprehensive financial services while accessing the Federal Reserve's clearing system. This move blurs the lines between on-chain finance and fiat banking, potentially leading to regulatory restructuring and a redefinition of capital market interactions. Short-term political and regulatory challenges are anticipated, but successful licensing could elevate crypto assets from investment products to essential components of the currency infrastructure, reshaping financial landscapes.

# News Comment
🪙 1. Event Recognition  
Cryptocurrency giants like Coinbase, Circle, BitGo, and Paxos are applying for U.S. banking licenses. This indicates that these native Web3 companies are attempting to enter the traditional banking system, heralding a new era of "compliant crypto banks."  

🎯 2. Motivation Analysis  
Crypto companies aim to shed their identity as “restricted payment networks” and provide comprehensive custody, payment, clearing, and savings services within the U.S., while gaining direct access to the Federal Reserve's clearing system to enhance capital efficiency and reduce dependence on traditional banks.  

🏛 3. Structural Perspective  
This is not just ordinary financial expansion but a substantial blurring of the boundaries between “on-chain finance vs fiat banking system”:  
- If platforms like Coinbase receive licenses, they will integrate Bitcoin, stablecoins, and savings accounts into the federal financial structure for the first time.  
- The Federal Reserve and OCC may face pressure to restructure their regulatory responsibilities.  
- The boundary between TradFi and CryptoFi will shift from “interoperability” to “integration.”  

🧮 4. Key Variables  
- Whether the Biden administration softens its "anti-crypto" stance (especially post-Trump's re-election).  
- The intensity of counteractive measures from the banking lobby.  
- Whether federal agencies like the FDIC and OCC accept crypto assets as a legitimate part of bank balance sheets.  
- Whether crypto banks can meet the capital adequacy and liquidity ratios mandated by the Basel Accord.  

📉 5. Trend Forecast  
In the short term, there will be political controversy and regulatory review cycles, but if a license is successfully obtained, it could lead to a reassessment of “crypto banks” in capital markets. In the mid-term, dollar-backed stablecoins may gain bank-level regulatory exemptions, significantly enhancing the liquidity of on-chain dollars.  

📐 Structural Summary  
This represents a deep intersection between Wall Street and the on-chain world. Crypto institutions are no longer external disruptors but are actively knocking on the doors of the system, aiming to become structural units within it. If successful, crypto assets will no longer be merely “investment products” but will become part of the “fundamental currency infrastructure.”
