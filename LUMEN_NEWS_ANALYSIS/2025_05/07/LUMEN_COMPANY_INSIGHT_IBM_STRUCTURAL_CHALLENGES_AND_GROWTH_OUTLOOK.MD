2. Motivation Analysis

IBM’s core business focuses on hybrid cloud computing, AI solutions, consulting services, and enterprise infrastructure. However, demand for traditional IT infrastructure has weakened, while competition in emerging technologies like cloud computing and AI has intensified. The transformation process faces significant market resistance, and stagnant earnings per share suggest that core competitiveness has not effectively translated into market share growth. Additionally, low capital returns reflect management's inefficiency in strategic investments.

3. Structural Perspective

From a LUMEN structural analysis perspective, IBM faces the following structural issues:
   1. Transformation hindered, market growth slowing
Although IBM has been transitioning to cloud computing and AI, the decline in traditional business is outpacing the growth of new businesses. Competition in hybrid cloud and AI is intense, significantly constraining IBM's growth potential from AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud.
   2. Low capital returns and investment efficiency
IBM’s capital return rate continues to decline, indicating that management's investment strategies have failed to boost market performance, which is detrimental in the high-capital IT industry.
   3. Disconnection between technological innovation and market positioning
Despite announcing multiple AI and quantum computing projects, there is a significant gap between these initiatives and actual market demand, resulting in weak revenue growth.

4. Key Variables
   1. Can growth in cloud computing and AI offset declines in traditional business?
   2. Can capital return rates improve to match industry competitors?
   3. Can management more effectively integrate acquisitions and technology development to enhance market share?
   4. How will global IT infrastructure spending growth impact future orders?

5. Trend Forecast

Based on LUMEN structural analysis, IBM will face more challenges in growth over the next 1-2 years. Intense competition in the hybrid cloud market will hinder expansion, while weak capital returns further undermine shareholder confidence. If management cannot quickly optimize capital allocation and accelerate cloud computing growth, IBM's market capitalization may continue to face pressure.

LUMEN Structural Analysis

IBM’s transformation faces significant structural challenges: declining traditional business, competition from emerging technologies, and weak capital returns hinder its competitiveness among tech giants. From a rational LUMEN structure perspective, IBM's strategic focus has not shifted quickly to high-growth segments, leading to delayed market responses and inefficient capital allocation. Unless significant transformation results can be demonstrated in the next two quarters, long-term growth expectations will continue to be underestimated by the market.
