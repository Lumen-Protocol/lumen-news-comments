LUMEN INSIGHT: US CHINA TRADE WAR ANALYSIS

# Summary
The U.S.-China trade war has escalated, with both nations imposing over 100% tariffs on each other, prompting U.S. Treasury Secretary's remarks deeming the situation "unsustainable." This has spurred a rebound in U.S. stocks while revealing internal tensions within the Trump administration.

# News Comment
1. Event Identification  
The U.S. and China have imposed over 100% tariffs on each other amid an escalating trade war. The U.S. Treasury Secretary called the trade war "unsustainable," resulting in a strong rebound in U.S. stocks, alongside increasing internal policy tensions within the Trump administration.

2. Motivation Analysis  
• The Treasury aims to address worsening fiscal deficits and rising debt interest rates. The tariff war negatively affects fiscal stability, prompting the Secretary's comments to maintain systemic stability.  
• The Secretary’s call for "rational cooling" seeks to stabilize trade expectations in capital markets and avoid overlapping crises like "structural inflation."  
• Public statements reflect systemic bureaucracy's response to disagreements with the White House, pushing for a "controllable conflict-gray buffer" model towards China.

3. Structural Perspective  
• The trade war has shifted from tariffs to dollar volatility, straining the Treasury as traditional trade weapons show diminishing returns.  
• The disconnect in approaches is evident as the White House focuses on elections while the Treasury tackles international financial stability.  
• Global capital is reclassifying "risk coordinates" in response to a superpower's internal strife and foreign policy conflicts.

4. Key Variables  
• Whether Trump endorses or criticizes the Treasury Secretary's remarks, impacting White House unity.  
• Potential collaboration between the Federal Reserve and Treasury on a "buffer mechanism."  
• China's response with possible easing signals or dialogue.  
• The international commodity market's reaction to U.S. credit risk pricing.

5. Trend Forecast  
Short-term, the Secretary's statement may reduce panic-driven capital outflows and boost U.S. stocks. However, continued high-pressure tactics from the White House might render this voice ineffective, leading to risks of "government inconsistency." Mid-term, failure to reestablish trade strategy coordination could decouple financial markets from policy, resulting in capital exit. Long-term trust in the "dollar system" will depend on consensus between the Treasury and White House.

Structure Summary  
The Treasury Secretary's remark on the trade war being "unsustainable" reflects a need for stability amid high tariffs and U.S.-China tensions. This highlights disarray within the U.S. national machinery, which could signal future market volatility and global restructuring, as structural conflict persists.
