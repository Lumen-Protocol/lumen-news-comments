1. Event Identification  
Korn Ferry's stock price is $64.04, with a target of $78.75, suggesting a 23% upside. Its average annual sales have declined by 2% over the past two years, and the sales growth forecast for the next year is only 1.6%. EPS has declined by 8.1% per year, reflecting worsening profitability, leading to a forward P/E of 12.5x.

2. Motivational Analysis  
Korn Ferry's core competency is providing consulting services to large organizations. However, many companies are currently focusing on cost reduction and efficiency, leading to less reliance on high-touch consulting. Additionally, HCM SaaS platforms have weakened Korn Ferry's position, while its high consulting costs and stagnant revenue growth create a mismatch with market trends.

3. Structural Perspective  
Korn Ferry employs a "non-productized, human-led, project-based delivery" model, depending on large, long-cycle projects sensitive to macroeconomic conditions. Rising SaaS penetration has exposed its structural weaknesses, including low revenue scalability and poor profit elasticity, transforming it into a "high-cost traditional consulting burden."

4. Key Variables  
- Structural transformation capability: Can it productize services for a SaaS model?  
- Integration of AI: Can it leverage AI to improve efficiency and insights?  
- Client budget willingness: Tight global economy constraints may limit KFYâ€™s growth.  
- Profit repair path: EPS lagging behind revenue could reinforce negative market perceptions.

5. Trend Forecast  
If Korn Ferry does not transform its consulting structure in the next 12 to 24 months, revenue and profits will continue to decline. The rise of AI in HR could erode key profit areas. A focus on system platforms over expensive consulting may lead KFY to marginalization and lower valuations. The critical factor will be establishing a "platform-based human resource structure" or risk becoming obsolete.

LUMEN Structural Summary  
Korn Ferry faces the pressures of "structural inflation + model rigidity + cyclical malfunction." Its reliance on macro-driven talent structure is eroding due to SaaS automation and AI alternatives. If it doesn't achieve structural advancement, its valuation will shift from growth to a shrinkage model.
