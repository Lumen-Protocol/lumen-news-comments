1. Event Identification  
President Trump posted on Truth Social, accusing the Democratic Party of illegally accepting foreign funds through the ACTBLUE platform, specifically naming Adam Schiff and Biden. He criticized the corruption of the pardon process, claiming these actions nearly destroyed America.  

2. Motivation Analysis  
Trump aims to reshape his image as a "cleaner of corruption and maintainer of national justice" by attacking the Democratic Party and issues from the Biden era. This also puts pressure on the current judicial system and political opponents, creating legitimacy for upcoming policy advances and campaign activities.  

3. Structural Perspective  
This statement combines narratives of "us vs. them," the "external threat" framework, and appeals to "legal justice," creating a high-emotion mobilization structure. By linking past issues (foreign donations, pardon practices) with the current regime's responsibilities, it reinforces the comparison of the opponent's illegitimacy against his own legitimacy.  

4. Key Variables  
- Whether judicial or congressional investigations into ACTBLUE or related pardons occur.  
- If the Republican Party broadly echoes Trump's accusations, creating political resonance.  
- Whether the Democratic Party and Biden's camp choose to counterattack or handle the situation lightly.  
- The dissemination and secondary development of public opinion, especially in conservative media.  

5. Trend Prediction  
If judicial or congressional investigations into ACTBLUE or the pardon events begin, Trump's camp will gain significant advantages in the short term, further suppressing Biden's camp. If investigations are obstructed or focus shifts, Trump will continue to leverage this issue as a political weapon, accumulating supporter sentiment and reinforcing the narrative of a "corrupted system."  

LUMEN Structure Summary  
This event demonstrates how Trump, upon gaining presidential power, quickly utilized judicial and media resources to strengthen systematic attacks on the Democratic Party. He reconstructs political legitimacy narratives in a highly emotional and clearly defined "us vs. them" manner, prompting opponents into a defensive stance and laying an emotional and structural foundation for subsequent policies and electoral strategies.
