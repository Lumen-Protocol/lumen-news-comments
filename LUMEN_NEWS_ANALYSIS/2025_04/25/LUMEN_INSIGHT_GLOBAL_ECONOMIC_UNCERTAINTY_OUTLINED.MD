LUMEN INSIGHT: GLOBAL ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY OUTLINED

# Summary
The IMF president identified "uncertainty" as the primary global economic threat, overshadowing tariffs amidst ongoing volatility in trade and policy. The statement calls for G20 nations to reduce "policy improvisation," especially regarding U.S.-China tariffs and European energy measures. A new economic risk framework prioritizes "cognitive structure" over traditional economic indicators, emphasizing how unpredictable policies can stifle investment. The IMF advocates for enhanced "structural certainty" to maintain market trust, signaling potential shifts in investment patterns and central bank strategies. Predictions suggest that "structural uncertainty" will redefine global economic challenges, compelling countries to adopt long-term stability mechanisms.

2. Motivation Analysis

The IMF's statement highlights:
   • A reshaping of the "macroeconomic responsibility view," prioritizing stability over short-term tax rates;
   • A signal to G20 countries to curb "policy improvisation," particularly with U.S.-China tariffs, Europe's energy interventions, and capital flow issues in developing nations;
   • A proactive stance against the potential return of Trump-style policies, identifying "policy reversals" as the main concern;
   • A strengthening of international institutions for enhanced "structural certainty";
   • An attempt to calm market reactions, providing a buffer for central banks.

3. Structural Perspective

This judgment reflects a new economic risk framework:
   • Traditional models focus on interest rates, tax rates, and employment;
   • In the new model, "cognitive structure" has become a variable: unpredictable policies hinder investment and business strategies;
   • The IMF's reference to "uncertainty" highlights the instability of institutions, notably the impact of Trump’s policies, European Central Bank issues, and unclear Chinese signals;
   • The IMF seeks to establish "expectational sustainability" as central to global market trust.

4. Key Variables
   • Whether the U.S. will create a long-term trade framework by 2025;
   • Whether Europe can align on energy, AI, and China policies;
   • Whether emerging markets will delay reforms due to uncertainty over IMF assistance;
   • Whether central banks will shift from "data dependency" to "structural expectation dependency";
   • Whether AI-generated economic data will lead to more accurate uncertainty predictions;
   • Whether investors will factor "uncertainty costs" into asset pricing.

5. Trend Prediction
   • "Structural uncertainty" will replace "inflation" as the main global economic issue;
   • Countries will implement "certainty guarantee mechanisms": long-term tax commitments, policy frameworks, and coordination agreements;
   • Multilateral institutions will gain status as key "institutional anchors";
   • Capital will flow to nations with high stability and transparency, influencing sovereign credit value;
   • Businesses will adopt a "policy reversal coefficient" in capital expenditure models.

LUMEN Structural Summary

As "tariffs" fade as an anchor of risk, "cognitive structural uncertainty" emerges as the core variable, signaling an era of **"policy wave function."** The IMF emphasizes that the future depends on the continuity of "institutional narratives," prompting an upgrade in trust models.
