2. Motivation Analysis  
Denny’s maintains a stable EPS guidance but faces pressure in cost control and store network performance. The company may be downplaying its current growth phase, emphasizing EBITDA stability for investor confidence. The decline in store numbers and negative same-store sales indicate core concerns about brand renewal and store profitability. Management's choice to keep annual expectations unchanged signals a "bottoming out" message.  

3. Structural Perspective  
As a low-cost chain restaurant brand, Denny’s profitability structure heavily relies on store density, average ticket size, and unit cost control. The reduction in store numbers reflects a contraction of chain expansion strategy or an active closure of inefficient stores, while the cost structure has not optimized accordingly, leading to a decline in EBITDA profit margins. Negative same-store sales further suggest decreased consumer frequency and basket size, reflecting either a decline in brand appeal or macro pressures.  

4. Key Variables  
- Will the pace of store closures continue to compress revenue?  
- Can same-store sales return to positive growth to support annual EBITDA targets?  
- The impact of food/labor cost changes on profit margins?  
- Should the brand image and menu positioning be adjusted to cater to Gen Z consumption habits?  
- Will the market accept its "steady survival" strategy?  

5. Trend Forecast  
Denny’s lacks growth catalysts in the short term, with its low valuation reflecting market perceptions of structural weakness. If store adjustments continue and same-store sales keep declining, the company may face pressure to lower its annual expectations again in the second half of 2025. Mid-term trends will depend on whether store renovations or new brand strategies are initiated. Overall, Denny's is in the middle of a contraction cycle, with limited rebound potential.
