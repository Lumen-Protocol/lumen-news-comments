LUMEN INSIGHT: ABBVIE CALLS FOR TAX REFORM

# Summary
AbbVie emphasizes the necessity of tax reform for enhancing U.S. manufacturing, arguing that current tariffs yield minimal benefits and elevate costs. The company's motivations include protecting its interests, lobbying for corporate tax relief, managing risks related to supply chain changes, and aligning with national sentiment regarding manufacturing. Utilizing a "structural substitution" strategy, AbbVie shifts the focus from tariffs to tax reform while ascribing job losses to internal cost structures. As multinational companies likely adopt similar perspectives, there is potential for a unified push for a "tax reform for manufacturing" agenda amid evolving public sentiment and congressional dynamics.

3. **Structural Perspective**  
AbbVie utilizes a "structural substitution" strategy:  
- **Agenda Shift:** It advocates for tax reform over directly confronting the tariff narrative.

- **Policy Co-optation:** By linking tax reform to retaining manufacturing jobs, it aligns its interests with national goals.
