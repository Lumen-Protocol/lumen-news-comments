LUMEN INSIGHT: TRUMP PROSPERITY CLAIMS FACE REALITY

# Summary
1. Event Recognition  
Bloomberg comments that despite Trump's promise to bring "unprecedented prosperity" to America if re-elected, such prosperity has not materialized in the way investors had hoped.

2. Motivation Analysis  
Trump's promise of "economic prosperity" relies on significant tax cuts, deregulation, expanding energy independence, and reshaping manufacturing through tariffs. In reality, this combination has stimulated certain sectors (like energy and defense) in the short term but caused greater uncertainty in the capital markets, limiting investor confidence. Politically, it aims to create visible growth symbols to solidify support from lower-income voters while enhancing America's negotiating power abroad.

2. Motivation Analysis  
Trump's promise of "economic prosperity" relies on significant tax cuts, deregulation, expanding energy independence, and reshaping manufacturing through tariffs. In reality, this combination has stimulated certain sectors (like energy and defense) in the short term but caused greater uncertainty in the capital markets, limiting investor confidence. Politically, it aims to create visible growth symbols to solidify support from lower-income voters while enhancing America's negotiating power abroad.

3. Structural Perspective  
Trump's economic strategy exchanges high-pressure policies for localized industry benefits, yet the global economy is a highly interconnected systemic structure: the tariff war raises cost chains and impedes cross-border investment flows, while fiscal easing leads to a rapid expansion of deficits and tightens dollar liquidity, impacting capital market pricing. This short-term stimulus coincides with medium- to long-term structural risks, undermining traditional investors' (especially institutional funds) confidence in U.S. assets. Perceptions of prosperity are reflected in underlying consumer data but are split in terms of capital asset returns (such as the stock and bond markets).

4. Key Variables  
- The pace of follow-up on Trump's tariff policies.  
- The direction of Federal Reserve monetary policy (interest rates, liquidity support).  
- The U.S. fiscal deficit and treasury market performance.  
- Global capital's willingness to allocate to U.S. assets (stocks, bonds, real estate).  
- Progress in geopolitical conflicts and supply chain restructuring.

5. Trend Forecast  
In the short term, U.S. economic data (such as employment, GDP growth) may maintain some resilience due to fiscal stimulus and localized industry recovery, but financial market volatility will increase, leading investors to adopt a cautious outlook for the future. In the medium to long term, if Trump continues to intensify tariffs and follows a de-globalization route alongside expanding fiscal deficits, this will increase the systemic risk premium for U.S. assets, weaken the dollar's hegemonic status, and make prosperity more prone to inflation-driven growth rather than an asset bull market.

LUMEN Structure Summary  
The economic prosperity pursued by Trump is essentially a form of "visible prosperity" rather than structural growth. The U.S. economy, functioning within the global capital system, cannot achieve long-term stable prosperity solely through tariffs and tax cuts. Investor disappointment reflects the tension between structural realities and political commitments, indicating a slow but irreversible adjustment in the future global capital allocation landscape. Trump's "prosperity" is more about localized industry elevation and asset differentiation rather than a broad upward trend in the overall capital markets.
