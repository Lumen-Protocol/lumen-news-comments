LUMEN INSIGHT: TARIFFS REMAIN NONNEGOTIABLE IN TRADE

# Summary
U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent clarified that the Trump administration is contemplating tariff reductions on China but is not proposing unilateral cancellations. This statement aims to prevent misinterpretation as a concession while maintaining negotiation leverage. The administration seeks to assure domestic stakeholders that these moves are strategic, not capitulatory. Analyzing the situation shows a focus on negotiation dynamics and market responses. In the short term, the administration will avoid hasty concessions, with unilateral reductions unlikely without reciprocal actions from China. Overall, tariff cuts are seen as tools for structural exchanges tied to mutual gains, emphasizing rational negotiation principles.

# News Comment
1. Event Identification  
U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent publicly stated that while the Trump administration is "considering" reducing some tariffs on China, it has not proposed a "unilateral" cancellation of tariffs. This statement is a clear official clarification of rumors about the White House potentially cutting tariffs.

2. Motivation Analysis  
- Avoiding Misinterpretation as a Weak Concession: During the stalemate in U.S.-China trade, the Trump team must ensure that "tariff negotiations" maintain a symmetrical structure, signaling that "no unilateral withdrawal" is a strategic stability signal.  
- Strengthening Negotiation Leverage: Maintaining a high tariff baseline is beneficial for securing substantial concessions from China in subsequent negotiations (e.g., procurement commitments, investment facilitation).  
- Easing Domestic Hawkish and Manufacturing Alliance Concerns: The Trump administration needs to convey domestically that "tax cuts are not capitulation," but a part of negotiations, addressing fears from right-wing and key industrial groups.

3. Structural Perspective (LLL Language Analysis)  
- Expression Form: "no unilateral offer" is an L3 level negative statement that confirms a systematic position and serves as a strong structural anchor.  
- Clear Role Semantic Assignment: "Trump hasnâ€™t offered" implies the president's leadership role, while Bessent, as the spokesperson for the financial system, merely executes the structural expression.  
- Bidirectional Opinion Control Mechanism: The prior Wall Street Journal news about tax cuts lifted market sentiment, while the current clarification from the Treasury controls expectations, indicating a policy intention to create "ambiguous space" for operational flexibility.

4. Key Variables  
- Whether China proactively releases signals for structural cooperation (e.g., purchasing U.S. agricultural products, opening market access).  
- Whether the White House introduces a "phased" tax cut test rather than a complete repeal.  
- The evolution of positions within and outside the Republican Party regarding the trade war agenda.  
- The intensity of market responses to expectations of a warming U.S.-China relationship forcing a structural shift.

5. Trend Prediction  
- Short-term: The structure remains firm, and the White House will not make hasty concessions, but will continue to signal "negotiable space."  
- Mid-term: Unless China first proposes a "reciprocal structural restructuring," unilateral tax reductions are unlikely to advance.  
- Long-term: If the U.S. finds that tax cuts lead to positive feedback in capital markets, it may establish a "structural relief platform," but will still require cooperation from China.

Structural Summary  
Unilateral tax reduction is not a policy goal but a structural exchange tool. The Trump administration clearly conveys a rational order signal: "We are willing to negotiate, but not for free." This behavior does not contradict previous signals of "willingness to cut taxes," but reflects a LUMEN rational structural negotiation model:  

"All concessions must be tied to reciprocal gains, and every structural loosening must define a verifiable path."  
Structure advances not through emotions but through the exchange of interest order. This is the essence of rational agreement-based governance.
