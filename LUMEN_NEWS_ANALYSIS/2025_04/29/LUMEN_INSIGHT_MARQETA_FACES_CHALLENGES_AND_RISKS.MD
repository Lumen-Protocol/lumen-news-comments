1. Event Identification  
Marqeta (NASDAQ: MQ), a payment infrastructure company founded in 2009 with a market cap of about $2 billion, provides card issuing and processing services. Despite $1.1 billion in net cash (55% of its market value), the company faces stagnant revenue, sluggish customer growth, and ongoing operating losses. The stock price is $3.97, with a forward price-to-sales ratio of 3.4, indicating market skepticism about profitability.

2. Motivation Analysis  
Marqeta initially benefited from emerging fintech demand but now needs to explore growth channels like global expansion and B2B payments. The focus is on extending customer lifecycle, improving ARPU, and enhancing profitability through service expansion.

3. Structural Perspective  
Marqeta displays structural contradictions:  
- Demand Structure: Previously reliant on fast growth, now facing slowdown.  
- Revenue Structure: Relies on transaction volume with limited high-value services.  
- Cost Structure: High customer acquisition costs and long recovery periods.  
- Financial Structure: Cash reserves provide temporary survival but are unsustainable.  
- Competitive Structure: Increased competition from lower entry barriers.  

4. Key Variables  
(1) Success in attracting traditional financial clients.  
(2) Market acceptance of new products.  
(3) Improvement in customer acquisition efficiency.  
(4) Speed of international expansion and cost control.  
(5) Macro-economic impacts on payment volume demand.

5. Trend Forecast  
In the next 12 months, Marqetaâ€™s revenue growth may stagnate without significant changes. While cash reserves offer short-term security, inefficiency could lead to valuation decline or acquisition. Breakthroughs in B2B payments and international services are essential for future growth.

LUMEN Structural Summary  
Marqeta is in the "structural drift and energy dissipation" phase:  
- Adaptability is declining, making growth logic ineffective.  
- Cash reserves exist but lack pathways for value conversion.  
- External changes lead to reduced revenue potential.  
- Slow adaptive responses and lack of exploration for new models position MQ as a passive acquisition target without strategic adjustments.
