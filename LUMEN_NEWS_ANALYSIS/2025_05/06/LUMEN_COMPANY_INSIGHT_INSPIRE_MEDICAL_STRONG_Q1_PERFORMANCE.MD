- Operating Margin: -0.7%, compared to -9.3% in the same period last year  
- Market Capitalization: $4.76 billion  

2. Motivational Analysis  
The company’s current strategy is focused on expanding revenue while quickly reducing losses, aiming to correct market expectations. The guidance was not raised, but the increase in full-year EPS reflects precise cost control and profitability turnaround, strengthening long-term value logic and stabilizing investor confidence.  

3. Structural Perspective  
Inspire is transitioning from a "loss-growth" model to a "profit-release" model, characterized by:  
- Revenue exceeding expectations, indicating strong demand growth  
- Nearly doubled EBITDA, showing simultaneous improvements in gross margin and expense control  
- Although Operating Margin remains negative, significant year-on-year recovery indicates a gradual approach to breakeven  
- Maintaining revenue guidance while raising EPS guidance signals an "efficiency transformation."  

4. Key Variables  
- U.S. and EU medical device access policies and insurance coverage progress  
- R&D schedule for new indications or product lines  
- Sustained operational leverage from improved sales team efficiency  
- Whether full-year revenue growth can maintain above 20% to support valuations  
- The market’s judgment on expectations for profitability versus cost burdens  

5. Trend Forecast  
INSP is entering the second phase of its valuation repair cycle, transitioning from "loss recovery to profit growth." In the short term, if Q2 can sustain the profit rhythm of this quarter, it may achieve positive EPS consistently for the first time for the full year, laying the foundation for a revaluation. In the mid-term, the tension between growth potential and breakeven timing will dominate stock price fluctuations; if the overall medical device sector rebounds, INSP possesses potential for a rebound with β+α attributes.
