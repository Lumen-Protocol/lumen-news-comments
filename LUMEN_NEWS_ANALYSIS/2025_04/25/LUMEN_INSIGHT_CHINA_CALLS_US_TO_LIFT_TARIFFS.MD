# Title
LUMEN INSIGHT: CHINA CALLS US TO LIFT TARIFFS

# Summary
In April 2025, China urged the U.S. to remove tariffs as part of a broader strategy to restructure Sino-American economic relations amid global inflation. Key motivations include economic strain, capital outflow responses, and seeking favorable public sentiment. The tariff issue reflects a complex interplay between trade, geopolitics, and technological sovereignty, with companies now entangled in political dynamics. Future outcomes depend on U.S. responses, corporate lobbying, and regional alliances. Failure to address China's request may lead to a stalemate, while reciprocal concessions could rejuvenate capital markets. This shift emphasizes the evolving nature of U.S.-China competition from trade disputes to structural power narratives.

1. Event Identification

In April 2025, the Chinese government officially called on the United States to lift tariffs. This position was publicly released through diplomatic channels and media, aimed at reshaping the dominance of the trade agenda and actively addressing the restructuring of Sino-American economic relations amid persistent global inflation pressures.

2. Motivation Analysis

China's motivation for proposing the removal of tariffs has multiple layers:
   • Economic Strain: Key industries (such as electronics, automobiles, chemicals) have been severely marginalized in the U.S. market.
   • Response to Capital Outflow: High tariffs have exacerbated supply chain diversification, weakening the stability of the Renminbi.
   • Seeking Public Opinion Advantage: Within the framework of “cooperation-competition-conflict,” releasing rational signals may help stabilize capital market confidence in Asia.
   • Lobbying Feedback from Enterprises: Major companies from both countries have formed a joint interest in lifting tariffs behind the scenes.

3. Structural Perspective

The current tariff issue is no longer just a “trade penalty” logic, but rather a multifaceted structural collision:
   • Trade → Geopolitics → Technological Sovereignty: Tariffs become tools for controlling technological diffusion and blocking.
   • State Actors → Market Agents: Companies are no longer neutral but are subjected to political conflict structures.
   • Legal Counteraction: The legitimacy of U.S. tariffs is increasingly challenged, while China seeks to reaffirm rule authority within the WTO and regional agreements.

4. Key Variables
   • Whether the U.S. will convert “inflation reduction” appeals into tax cuts/tariff reductions under election pressure.
   • Whether corporate inventory and cost structures push them to lobby the U.S. Treasury to loosen tariff policies.
   • Whether European and Southeast Asian countries will choose “structural alignment” or accelerate supply chain decoupling from China.
   • Whether the Renminbi continues to depreciate to a strategic warning level, prompting China to negotiate more quickly.
   • The level of tolerance of the Trump or Biden administration towards “upgrading Chinese manufacturing” in the next phase.

5. Trend Prediction

If the U.S. does not respond to China's request for tariff removal within the next 60 days, it will enter a mid-term stalemate mode of “bilateral consumption + corporate waiting.” The U.S. may signal a relaxation of technology controls as a substitute for direct tariff concessions. Conversely, if Sino-American “technical mutual concessions” occur before the G7 or APEC meetings, capital markets may preemptively recover expectations of a “manufacturing supply chain split.”

LUMEN Structural Summary

Tariffs are not just numbers; they are structural parameters of the global order. China’s move is not a cry from the weak but the first step in restructuring. In facing the U.S. logic of “sanctions as policy,” China opts to test the bargaining space with a “rational request.” The focus of this game has shifted from product prices to who writes the system rules. The U.S.-China competition is evolving from trade conflict to a power game of structural narratives.
