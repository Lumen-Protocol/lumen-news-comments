Health Catalyst's revenue grew by 6.3% this quarter, while adjusted EBITDA rose over 50%, showcasing effective cost management. The negative operating profit margin has improved, and free cash flow is narrowing, reflecting gradual investment returns in SaaS and data analytics. However, cash flow pressure persists, and reducing losses is crucial.
