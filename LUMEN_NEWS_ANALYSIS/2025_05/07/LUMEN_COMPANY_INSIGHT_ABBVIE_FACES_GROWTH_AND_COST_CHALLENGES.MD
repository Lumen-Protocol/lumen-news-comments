2. Motivational Analysis

AbbVie faces dual pressures of stagnant growth and rising costs, with sales not significantly improving over the past two years, while costs are eroding profit margins. Its expansion in global markets has underperformed, and core products are confronted with market competition and patent expiration pressures. The rise in costs outpacing revenue growth has resulted in a 9.2% decline in adjusted profit margins, indicating structural challenges in cost management and global market expansion.

3. Structural Perspective
   • Revenue stagnation and profit compression: The market performance of core products has not yielded new growth, and international market expansion is hitting bottlenecks.
   • Weak cost management: Cost increases over the past two years have surpassed revenue growth, directly compressing profit margins.
   • Poor international market performance: Growth at constant exchange rates is below market expectations, demonstrating weak international expansion.

4. Key Variables
   1. Market performance of core drugs and development of alternatives post-patent expiration.
   2. Progress in cost control and operational efficiency improvements.
   3. Expansion in emerging markets and development of diversified product lines.
   4. Whether R&D investments can lead to competitively marketable new products.

5. Trend Forecast

In the next two years, AbbVie may face increased competitive pressure, particularly after the patent expirations of core drugs, as generic drugs entering the market will significantly lower revenue growth. Additionally, if internal cost optimization does not make breakthroughs, adjusted operating profit margins may continue to be pressured. Unless the company can quickly expand new product lines and optimize its internal cost structure, stock performance may struggle to achieve significant breakthroughs.
