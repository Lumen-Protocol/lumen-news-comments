2. Motivation Analysis

From on-chain trading behavior:
1. Short-term probing and quick liquidation: solsmart32 and pow quickly liquidated after high-frequency buying, indicating bearish market expectations.
2. Trial new entry: solsmart52, as a new entrant, hasn't sold and currently holds $30.39, but the ROI shows significant losses.
3. Large buy concentrated sell-off: multiple Smart Traders quickly liquidating indicates a lack of market confidence, putting pressure on prices.

3. Structural Insights

From a LUMEN structural analysis perspective:
• Rapid capital outflow: solsmart32 and pow's liquidation actions were quick and concentrated, indicating weak market liquidity.
• New funds face losses: solsmart52’s early entry results in heavy losses, showing a clear liquidity drain effect in the market.
• High-frequency short-term operations dominate: multiple buy and sell transactions within 7 hours suggest a trend of high-frequency arbitrage, lacking long-term funding support.

⸻

4. Key Variables
• Will solsmart52 quickly liquidate: its current holdings are small, but as the only wallet not fully liquidated, its actions will indicate the short-term market direction.
• Can new funds continue to flow in: the liquidity of FAP has been rapidly drained by high-frequency trading, and without new funds, prices will likely continue to fall.
• Possibility of short-term fund rebound: if large funds flow back in the short term, it could lead to a brief price rebound.

5. Trend Prediction
1. Price under short-term pressure: high-frequency liquidation actions have weakened market liquidity, making it difficult for prices to improve in the short term.
2. Low probability of temporary rebound: unless large new funds enter, solsmart52's holdings may likely be sold off actively.
3. High-frequency arbitrage funds withdraw quickly: if no new funds are injected, continued price drops are highly probable.

LUMEN Structural Analysis

The FAP project exhibits clear characteristics of rapid short-term arbitrage, with most large buys being liquidated quickly, showing extremely low market confidence and poor liquidity. The heavy losses for new entrant solsmart52 further amplify the market's sell pressure risk. Without new liquidity injections, the market will continue to seek lower support levels. It is advised to closely monitor the flow of new funds on-chain and the movements of solsmart52.
