2. Motivational Analysis
	1. High-risk investment and quick withdrawal: The project is marked as high risk, and all three major wallets opted for rapid liquidation, especially solsmart16, which decisively exited with a loss of 62.98%, showing a clear tendency for risk aversion.
	2. Short-term arbitrage did not meet expectations: CryptoD and solsmart78 did not achieve anticipated returns, and their rapid exit indicates a lack of market confidence.
	3. Liquidity risks: The trading volume is relatively low compared to market capitalization, suggesting that selling pressure could lead to greater price volatility.

3. Structural Perspective

From the perspective of LUMEN structure analysis:
	•	Funds are exiting rapidly: The complete liquidation by solsmart78, solsmart16, and CryptoD reflects fears of further price declines.
	•	High-risk label evident: The project is marked as high risk with evident selling pressure in the short term, and funds have not been effectively locked in.
	•	Market sentiment is bearish: The simultaneous liquidation indicates that market participants do not have a positive outlook on future developments.

---

4. Key Variables
	•	New funds inflow: Without significant new funds entering, the price will struggle to find support.
	•	Market reaction after liquidation: The liquidation by the three major wallets may trigger larger panic selling.
	•	Trading depth and liquidity: Currently, trading volume is low and lacking market depth, meaning large sell-offs will directly impact the price.

---

5. Trend Prediction
	1. Downside risk remains: The current trading volume cannot support buy orders; further price declines are expected in the short term.
	2. Impact of fund withdrawals: If no major funds step in, selling pressure will worsen liquidity.
	3. Clear bearish market signals: If new buying power is not attracted, the market may enter a sustained correction.

LUMEN structure analysis

The gf project displays clear high-risk attributes, with major funds exiting quickly, insufficient market liquidity, and no signs of new buy-ins in the short term. Without additional funds entering, the selling pressure on the project will become more pronounced, and a significant rebound in price is unlikely. It is advisable to monitor large on-chain funds' movements and any signs of improvement in market liquidity.
