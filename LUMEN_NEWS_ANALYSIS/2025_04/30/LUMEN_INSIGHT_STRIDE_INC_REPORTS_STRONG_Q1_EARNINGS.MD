   - Revenue grew 17.8% year-on-year, with profit growth indicating effective growth  
   - Growth in both EBITDA and Operating Margin shows profitability leverage  
   - Long-term CAGR of 17.3% suggests sustained multi-cycle growth  
   - Company has moved beyond initial instability to structural amplification  
   - Revenue generated primarily from the U.S., with potential for regional expansion  

4. Key Variables  
(1) Maintaining annual revenue growth above 15% to sustain valuation premium  
(2) Stability of unit economics model—upward trend in gross and EBITDA margins  
(3) External policy support for K12 and adult re-education  
(4) User activity and renewal rates affecting cyclicality  
(5) Efficiency in capital expenditure and R&D investment impacting long-term defensibility  

5. Trend Forecast  
Stride is expected to benefit from structural trends in digital education, with revenue growth between 15%-20% mid-term. If profit leverage is maintained, EPS could exceed $6. Risks include policy fluctuations or competitive cost pressures.  

LUMEN Structural Summary  
Stride is a “medium-sized positively entropic educational structure,” characterized by high growth and profit margin expansion. If performance is sustained, Stride may upgrade to a higher platform structure. Risk signals include gross margin declines or a CAGR below 13%.

Conclusion: Stride represents an ideal medium-sized structural growth model in education, suitable for long-term holding.
