2. Motivation Analysis

Observing the on-chain activity of these three Smart Traders suggests the following motivations:
   1. Trend-following strategy: solsmart18 and solsmart74 made multiple buys in a short period, indicating they believe the price may rise further.
   2. High-frequency arbitrage liquidation: solsmart88 completed multiple trades and cleared their balance in 11 hours, with a loss of 60.38%, possibly a failed short-term speculation.
   3. Creating signals to guide buys: The large buy of $8.17K in a project with a market cap of only $986K could trigger price fluctuations, aiming to increase trading activity and guide market sentiment.

3. Structural Insights

From the LUMEN structural analysis, the trading movements of this project reveal the following structural risks and opportunities:
   • Low market cap and high volatility: Chewy's market cap is under $1M, but trading volume is close to $2M, suggesting high trading activity and price instability.
   • Single-point impact effect: The $8K buy from a single wallet significantly affects the overall price, indicating weak liquidity and susceptibility to manipulation.
   • Synchronization of wallet transactions: The buying pace of solsmart18 and solsmart74 is similar, while solsmart88 quickly liquidated, which may indicate a multi-address hedging strategy.

---

4. Key Variables
   • On-chain liquidity: A decrease in the liquidity pool assets may indicate that the traders are beginning to withdraw funds gradually.
   • Large transfer monitoring: Significant transfers from solsmart18 or solsmart74 may signal potential short-term profit-taking.
   • Token contract permissions: Check if Mint and Burn permissions are concentrated in a few addresses to avoid Rug Pull risk.
   • Transaction frequency and distribution: If trades are concentrated among a few wallets with short intervals, it represents highly coordinated market manipulation.

---

5. Trend Forecast
   1. Price fluctuations likely in the short term: solsmart18 and solsmart74 still hold substantial positions; further buying could push the market higher.
   2. High-risk selling signals: Quick decreases in the liquidity pool or large holders starting to sell in batches would indicate a peak in short-term price increases.
   3. Potential for wash trading or Rug Pull: If solsmart18 and solsmart74 both sell off while solsmart88 has cleared, there will be significant correction risks ahead.

---

LUMEN structural analysis indicates that the current on-chain activity of Chewy shows intent to create short-term activity to attract market attention, while the high-frequency buying and rapid liquidation by a few wallets signal highly concentrated market manipulation. Should large holders sell simultaneously, prices will quickly drop. It is advised to continue monitoring the transaction dynamics of these two large wallets and observe for signs of rapid withdrawals from the liquidity pool.
