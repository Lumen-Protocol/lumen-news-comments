1. Event Identification  
Mondelez (NASDAQ: MDLZ) released its Q1 2025 financial report, showing flat overall revenue but a significant decline in profit margins, highlighting the severe erosion of profitability due to cost pressures. Key figures include revenue of $9.31 billion, in line with market expectations; adjusted EPS of $0.74, exceeding expectations by 12.2%; however, adjusted EBITDA was only $1 billion, far below the market expectation of $1.54 billion, a miss of 34.7%. Operating profit margin plunged from 29.4% to 7.3%, and free cash flow margin fell to 8.8%. Organic revenue grew 3.1% year-on-year, but sales declined by 3.5%. The company's current market value is approximately $84.3 billion.

2. Motivation Analysis  
Faced with high raw material costs (especially cocoa) and weak consumer demand, the company has raised product prices to stabilize revenue, but this has led to continued sales decline. Its short-term motivation is to maintain revenue stability and address capital market expectations; long-term, it aims to leverage brand influence to increase unit value, though it has yet to effectively translate this into profit recovery.

3. Structural Perspective  
Mondelez displays a typical structural contradiction of "raising prices to preserve revenue while profits are squeezed." Although revenue has held steady, the significant drop in EBITDA indicates that the pricing strategy has not fully covered cost pressures, particularly from raw materials and transportation in a high-inflation environment. The mass-market product categories in its portfolio are highly price-sensitive, resulting in a lose-lose situation for price and sales; structural leverage is failing, leading to a contraction in margins.

4. Key Variables  
- Fluctuations in cocoa and sugar raw material prices will directly affect future profit elasticity;  
- Consumers' tolerance limits for continued price increases will determine whether organic growth can be sustained;  
- The brand's ability to fend off comparable substitutes;  
- Speed of cost structure optimization and improvement in supply chain synergy.

5. Trend Prediction  
If raw material prices continue to remain high while the company maintains revenue through price increases, sales decline will worsen, leading to further deterioration in profitability. In the medium term, Mondelez may need to rely on layoffs, streamlining SKUs, and cutting operational costs to restore EBITDA elasticity. Until structural imbalances are addressed, valuation will increasingly depend on cash flow stability rather than growth.

LUMEN Structural Summary:  
Mondelez is currently experiencing structural compression: rising rigidity on the cost side and nearing the pricing limit on the revenue side, creating a counter-structural tension of "stable revenueâ€”declining profits." Its business model is shifting from "strong brands driving profitability" to "strong brands delaying decline," with valuation likely to be re-priced around low growth, high brand strength, but weak profit elasticity.
