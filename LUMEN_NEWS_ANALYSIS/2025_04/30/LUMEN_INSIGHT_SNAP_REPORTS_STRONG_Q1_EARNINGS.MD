   • Current market cap is $14.98 billion  

Snap has entered the phase of "revenue growth restart + initial loss improvement."  

2. Motivational Analysis  
Reasons for exceeding profitability in Q1:  
   • Recovery in the advertising market, especially in North America and APAC  
   • Enhanced short video content and Creator Monetization, improving retention  
   • Reduction in content and operational costs, improving unit economics  
   • Increased investment in AI and AR technologies, enhancing brand collaborations  
   • Strategy focused on cash flow priority and expense control  

3. Structural Perspective  
Snap's structure includes:  
   • Revenue mainly from advertising, with growth driven by recovery  
   • Effective cost control, shown by improved Operating Margin  
   • DAU over 460 million, MAU over 900 million, supporting user scale  
   • Positive EBITDA and Free Cash Flow, but still near loss boundary  
   • Growth from AR Lens, Spotlight videos, and My AI components  

4. Key Variables  
(1) Maintaining double-digit ARPU growth is crucial for positive entropy transition  
(2) Stability of Free Cash Flow will influence financing independence  
(3) Daily active growth above 8% signals user sustainability  
(4) Advertiser expenditure recovery affects profitability stability  
(5) AR/AI commercialization potential will shape future valuation  

5. Trend Forecast  
Snap anticipates 10%-15% revenue growth in 2025, positive adjusted EBITDA, and consistent Free Cash Flow. It approaches the profit-loss inflection point and may achieve sustainable profitability in 2026, shifting valuation from "growth narrative" to "cash flow model."  

Conclusion: Snap has built an initial positive entropy model of "profit transformation + user scale effect." Continued efficiency and AR commercialization could enhance its valuation by mid to late 2025. Recommend ongoing tracking of positive entropy variables.
