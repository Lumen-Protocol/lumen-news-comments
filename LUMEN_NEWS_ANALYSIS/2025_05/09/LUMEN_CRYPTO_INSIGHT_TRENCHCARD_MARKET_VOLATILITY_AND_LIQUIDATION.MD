2. Motivational Analysis

From on-chain transaction behavior:
1. Short-term stop-loss operations: The sell-off by evmsmart103 resulted in a -73.55% loss, indicating rapid stop-loss decisions due to market volatility.
2. Liquidation to exit: evmsmart5 and evmsmart12 sold quickly with no ROI displayed, suggesting no profit or a decision to exit on minor fluctuations.
3. Insufficient market liquidity: The liquidation by multiple Smart Traders may indicate weak market liquidity and a lack of funding support to push prices higher.

⸻
3. Structural Perspective

From the perspective of LUMEN structure analysis:
- High liquidity liquidations: Multiple wallets sold quickly with minimal delay, showing a lack of confidence in future market performance.
- High risk of short-term volatility: The significant loss for evmsmart103 indicates severe price fluctuations in the short term.
- Significant capital outflow: All three major wallets liquidated in a short period, showing clear internal capital outflow in the market.

⸻
4. Key Variables
- New capital inflow: With many liquidations currently, new Smart Traders are needed to stabilize prices.
- Changes in liquidity pools: If capital continues to flow out, TrenchCard's liquidity will be impacted.
- Monitoring short-term volatility: Further exits by more wallets will directly affect price volatility.
- Monitoring buy depth: If there are no more buy orders in the next 24 hours, the project might face greater selling pressure.

⸻
5. Trend Prediction
1. Increased volatility in the short term: Rapid liquidation by large holders leads to a decline in market liquidity, resulting in significant short-term volatility risks.
2. Significant downside risk: Without new capital inflow, current selling pressure may further push prices down.
3. On-chain capital monitoring: New large purchases may briefly correct prices, but there are no signs indicating large capital inflow.

LUMEN Structure Analysis

The current on-chain data of the TrenchCard project shows significant capital outflow and short-term stop-loss characteristics, with multiple Smart Traders selling quickly, reflecting a lack of confidence in future market performance. The market lacks new capital inflow to support current price levels; if no large buy orders appear within the next 24 hours, the market is expected to remain under pressure. It is recommended to monitor the depth of liquidity pools and the movements of large on-chain funds to gauge potential selling pressure.
