3. Structural Perspective  
Napco’s structural advantages are reflected in several aspects:  
- Growth Structure: Achieving an 11.8% CAGR in a low-growth traditional security market indicates enhanced product competitiveness and market penetration.  
- Cash Flow Structure: A 16.3% free cash flow rate provides ample internal financing sources and reduces dependence on external financing.  
- Capital Return Structure: Increasing capital return rates reflect management's enhanced execution capability in investment and operational allocation.  
- Market Positioning Structure: Focused on stable, essential fields (e.g., security for schools and government facilities), with strong demand elasticity and good cyclicality resistance.

4. Key Variables  
- Changes in Government and Education Spending Budgets: Variations in spending from this major customer group will directly impact Napco’s order volume.  
- New Product Penetration Rate: Continuing to launch products that meet new security demands (e.g., smart connected devices) will further enhance the growth curve.  
- Competitive Landscape Changes: If large security companies increase penetration in the low-end market, it may squeeze Napco’s profit margins.  
- Macroeconomic Interest Rate Environment: A high-interest rate environment may affect the capital expenditure pacing of government and educational institutions, indirectly impacting Napco’s orders.

5. Trend Forecast  
It is anticipated that within the next 12 months, Napco, with its strong cash flow and increased market share, could achieve robust revenue growth in the mid-single to low-double digits, with continuous capital return rate improvement and enhanced shareholder return potential. In the medium to long term (2-3 years), if the company can expand through mergers or new product breakthroughs, it will further strengthen its competitive moat.
