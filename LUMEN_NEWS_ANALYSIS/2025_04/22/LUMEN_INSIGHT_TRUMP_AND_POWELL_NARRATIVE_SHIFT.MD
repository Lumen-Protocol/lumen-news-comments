LUMEN INSIGHT: TRUMP AND POWELL NARRATIVE SHIFT

# Summary
The Financial Times highlights a shift in narrative, suggesting that Trump requires cooperation from Powell amid economic uncertainties following his re-election. Trump's agenda seeks to reshape the economic discourse towards inflation stability and fiscal reforms, necessitating a collaborative stance from the Federal Reserve. The comments explore the inherent paradox of the Fed's independence versus political influence, demonstrating how historical precedents have allowed presidents to navigate monetary policy. The article forecasts a potential new phase characterized by decentralized coordination, where Trump applies multi-faceted pressure on the Fed, leading to strategic shifts in interest rates and market alignment over the coming months.

# News Comment
1. **Event Identification**  
The Financial Times points out that "Trump needs Powell," shifting the narrative away from "Trump pressures the Federal Reserve" to emphasize their interdependence. This change in narrative occurs at a crossroads where Trump has been re-elected, the U.S. economy faces stagflation risks, and the Federal Reserve is hesitating to clarify its interest rate path, signaling a market re-evaluation of the "fiscal-monetary-election" triangle during Trump's second term.

2. **Motivation Analysis**  
Trump's team aims to restart the economic narrative of "inflation stability + asset inflation + dollar repatriation" to ensure a strong economic start in 2025, allowing space for tax reform 2.0 and fiscal stimulus. This requires the Fed's cooperation in lowering interest rates, increasing liquidity, and stabilizing bond market expectations. However, under Powell's leadership, the Fed remains focused on the "final mile" of inflation, taking on a more "technically neutral" stance. Trump needs a "first attack, then pull back" strategy to create public pressure on Powell while signaling collaboration privately to enable phased monetary easing.

3. **Structural Perspective**  
On the surface, Trump’s dual role of "attacking the Fed and needing Powell" reflects a paradox in the Fed's institutional design: high independence, yet vulnerable to political cycles influencing expectations. In practice, the president controls fiscal and trade instruments while the Fed manages monetary tools. When the president enjoys overwhelming public support, the Fed's independence often shifts to compliance. Historically, leaders like Nixon, Reagan, and Trump have used a blend of "external criticism + internal positioning" to shape a Fed that accommodates stimulus.

4. **Key Variables**  
- **Stability of Powell's Tenure:** While difficult to dismiss legally, Trump could undermine his authority or place allies in the FOMC.  
- **Market Reaction to Rate Cuts:** If the asset market anticipates cuts due to Trump’s pressure, it may constrain Powell’s options.  
- **Trends in Inflation and Employment Data:** A technical recession in early 2025 could provide Powell with justification for a shift in policy.  
- **Alignment of Fiscal Policies:** If Trump successfully pushes for significant tax cuts or infrastructure initiatives, the Fed might adjust rates under the premise of not undermining fiscal policy.

5. **Trend Forecast**  
If the idea that "Trump needs Powell" becomes mainstream, the U.S. may enter a new macro phase characterized by "decentralized coordination"—not exclusively led by the White House or the Fed but rather by the president exerting multi-faceted pressure on the Fed through markets, media, and public opinion, eventually forcing rate cuts. Over the next three months, we may see:  
- Trump softening personal attacks on Powell, signaling trust if Powell returns to his original intent.  
- Wall Street analysts pivoting to a favorable view of "policy coordination," supporting rate cuts with theoretical rationale and market sentiment.  
- Powell using more phrases like "wait for data" and "flexibility" in public speeches, leaving room for policy adjustment.

**Structural Summary**  
"Trump needs Powell" is not an emotional dependence but a structural mutual benefit. While publicly appearing as adversaries, they are co-creating a new political-financial order characterized by fiscal leadership, monetary cooperation, and market endorsement. For the market, this is a new kind of "monetary theater": Trump designs the plot while Powell delays the finale. The real script has already commenced—yet the audience remains unaware of their involvement in this structural pricing game.
