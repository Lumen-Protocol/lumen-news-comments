2. Motivation Analysis
   1. Short-term high-risk arbitrage: The exits of solsmart3 and solsmart32 indicate they may have attempted short-term arbitrage but quickly withdrew after losses.
   2. Individual holding strategy: solsmart35 retains some positions and realized a 34.1% profit, showing optimism or a wait-and-see approach regarding future market trends.
   3. Market low liquidity: Overall trading volume is only $11.9K, with low capital depth, meaning even minor sell pressure could lead to larger declines.

3. Structural Perspective

From the perspective of LUMEN structural analysis:
   • Weak capital flow: Minor inflows and outflows have significantly impacted the market, indicating extremely low liquidity.
   • Significant short-term volatility: The losses from solsmart3's exit and the profit from solsmart35's holding reflect the market's high volatility.
   • Lack of major support: There have been no persistent large capital inflows in the market, with only sporadic holders engaging in speculation.

---

4. Key Variables
   • Next actions for solsmart35: If it continues to hold, it will be the primary market support; if it chooses to exit, it could trigger a new downturn.
   • Involvement of new funds: If new buyers step in, it would significantly relieve selling pressure; otherwise, the market may continue to seek a bottom.
   • Changes in liquidity depth: If market depth cannot be increased shortly, price volatility will become more severe.

---

5. Trend Forecast
   1. Increased short-term volatility: Low liquidity means that even minor trades can lead to drastic price changes, and volatility is expected to continue escalating in the short term.
   2. Potential for correction risk: If solsmart35 chooses to close positions, the market may struggle to withstand selling pressure, leading to significant corrections.
   3. Capital injection determines direction: Without new major funds entering, the likelihood of a short-term rebound is low.

LUMEN Structural Analysis

The SKI project currently exhibits a high volatility and fragile market structure, with major funds almost withdrawn, leaving only a few holders in speculation. The holdings of solsmart35 determine the lifeline of the short-term market, while overall market liquidity is severely lacking; a significant sell-off could trigger a waterfall decline. It is suggested to closely monitor the transfer of large on-chain funds and the movements of solsmart35.
