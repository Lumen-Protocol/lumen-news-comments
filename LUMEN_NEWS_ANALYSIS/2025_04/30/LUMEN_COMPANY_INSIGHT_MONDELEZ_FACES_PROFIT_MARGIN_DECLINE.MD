1. Event Identification  
Mondelez (NASDAQ: MDLZ) released its Q1 2025 financial report, showing flat overall revenue but a significant decline in profit margins, highlighting the severe erosion of profitability due to cost pressures. Key data includes: revenue at $9.31 billion, meeting market expectations; adjusted EPS at $0.74, exceeding expectations by 12.2%; however, adjusted EBITDA was only $1 billion, far below the expected $1.54 billion, a miss of 34.7%. Operating profit margin plunged from 29.4% to 7.3%, and free cash flow margin fell to 8.8%. Organic revenue grew 3.1% year-over-year, but sales volume declined by 3.5%. The current market capitalization of the company is approximately $84.3 billion.

2. Motivational Analysis  
In the face of high raw material costs (especially cocoa) and weak consumer demand, the company has been raising product prices to stabilize revenue, but this has led to continued declines in sales. Their short-term motive is to ensure revenue stability and maintain credibility with capital markets; long-term, they aim to enhance unit value through brand influence, but have not effectively converted it into profit recovery.

3. Structural Perspective  
Mondelez exhibits a typical structural contradiction of "raising prices to maintain revenue while profit is squeezed." Despite holding revenue steady, the significant drop in EBITDA indicates that pricing strategies have not fully covered cost impacts, particularly from high inflation affecting raw materials and transportation costs. Price-sensitive mainstream product categories have created a loss-loss scenario in price and volume; structural leverage effects have failed, leading to widespread profit margin contraction.

4. Key Variables  
- Fluctuations in cocoa and sugar prices will directly affect future profit elasticity;  
- Consumer tolerance for sustained price increases will determine if organic growth can continue;  
- Brand strength against competing substitutes;  
- Rate of improvement in cost structure optimization and supply chain synergies.

5. Trend Forecast  
If raw material prices remain high and the company continues to rely on price increases to stabilize revenue, a further decline in sales will worsen profitability. In the medium term, Mondelez may need to rely on layoffs, SKU rationalization, and cutting operational expenses to restore EBITDA elasticity. Until structural imbalances are addressed, valuation will increasingly depend on cash flow stability rather than growth potential.

LUMEN Structural Summary:  
Mondelez is in a period of structural compression: rising cost rigidity and revenue side nearing price increase limits create an anti-structural tension of "stable incomeâ€”profit loss." Its business model is shifting from "strong brand driving profitability" to "strong brand delaying decline," with valuation expected to be repriced around low growth, high brand strength, but weak profit elasticity.
