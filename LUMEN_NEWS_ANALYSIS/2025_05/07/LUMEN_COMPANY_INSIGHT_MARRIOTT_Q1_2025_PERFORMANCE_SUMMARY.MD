1. Event Identification  
Marriott International (NASDAQ: MAR) released its Q1 2025 financial report, exceeding market expectations:  
   • Revenue: $6.26 billion (up 4.8% year-on-year)  
   • Adjusted EPS: $2.32  
   • Adjusted EBITDA: $1.22 billion (19.4% profit margin)  
   • Full-year adjusted EPS guidance: $10.00  
   • Full-year EBITDA guidance: $5.36 billion  
   • Operating profit margin: 15.1%  
   • RevPAR: $181.75, up 53.9% year-on-year  
   • Market capitalization: $68.09 billion  

2. Motivation Analysis  
Marriott's Q1 performance was driven by the recovery of global and business travel, with RevPAR reflecting strong room demand. Revenue growth resulted from increased room prices and optimized occupancy rates, while adjusted EBITDA showed effective cost management. However, the operating profit margin remained unchanged, indicating profit expansion limitations due to cost pressures and competition.  

3. Structural Perspective  
Marriott's operational structure includes:  
   • Global presence: Over 7,000 properties in 130+ countries  
   • Multi-brand strategy: 30 brands catering to diverse markets  
   • Asset-light model: Focus on franchising and management contracts  
   • Digital operations: Enhanced online booking and loyalty programs  

This structure allows Marriott to benefit from market recovery while minimizing regional risks. However, a 4.2% annual growth rate is below industry average, necessitating market expansion efforts.  

4. Key Variables  
   • Economic recovery and tourism revival impact occupancy and RevPAR  
   • Cost management alongside revenue growth enhances net profit  
   • Brand enhancement and market penetration in emerging markets  
   • Expansion of the asset-light model to reduce capital expenditure  

5. Trend Forecast  
In the next 12 months, Marriott is expected to benefit from the recovery in global tourism. However, economic slowdowns or pandemic disruptions may trigger market contractions. Inflation and energy costs will pressure profit margins, though investments in digital experiences could enhance market share.  

LUMEN Structural Summary  
   • Revenue growth → RevPAR recovery → Operational stability → Cost control → Market penetration  
   • Asset-light model and global network reduce regional volatility risks  
   • Management has maintained EBITDA growth, but profit margin expansion requires optimization  
   • Marriott’s global layout provides risk resilience, but it must overcome the 4.2% growth bottleneck by focusing on emerging markets and high-end segments.  

Marriott's core challenge is optimizing profit expansion during recovery and addressing the segmented needs of emerging markets and high-net-worth customers.
