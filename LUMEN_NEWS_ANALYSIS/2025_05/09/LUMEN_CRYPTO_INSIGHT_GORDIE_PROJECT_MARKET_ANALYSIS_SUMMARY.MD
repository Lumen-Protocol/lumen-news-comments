3. Structural Perspective

From the LUMEN structural analysis:
   • Fast capital outflow: Major funds quickly sold off, especially evmsmart110 exiting with profits, leading to significant short-term selling pressure.
   • Divergent risk preferences: evmsmart97 is still holding, while evmsmart69 and evmsmart110 have fully liquidated, indicating differing views on the project's future.
   • High market uncertainty: Low trading volume implies that a single large sale can significantly impact the price.

4. Key Variables
   • Subsequent actions of evmsmart97: As the only wallet not liquidated, its actions will significantly influence market sentiment.
   • Changes in trading volume: Without new funds entering, the market may face liquidity exhaustion risks.
   • Inflow of new funds: Additional capital could alter the current downtrend.

5. Trend Forecast
   1. High short-term volatility risk: Several major holders have liquidated, and the market lacks support, likely continuing its downward trend.
   2. Monitor changes in evmsmart97's position: If it opts to liquidate, the market could face new downward pressure.
   3. Liquidity issues: Without new capital injection, the probability of price rebound is low, and sell-offs will accelerate.

LUMEN Structural Analysis

The GORDIE (Solana) project has shown extreme volatility in capital inflow and outflow, with some major holders choosing to quickly stop losses or exit profits, aggravating short-term market fluctuations. The holding of evmsmart97 becomes a key variable; without new liquidity support, the market will remain under pressure. It is advisable to closely monitor this address's subsequent actions and potential new fund inflows.
