LUMEN NEWS: TARIFF POLICY AND TRADE STRATEGIES5

# Summary
In April 2025, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced that the U.S. would provide "substantial clarity" on tariff policies within 90 days, impacting international market perceptions. Concurrently, China's Foreign Ministry suggested that upcoming trade dialogues could incorporate the Taiwan issue, indicating a political dimension to the timeline. This reflects a complex interplay of motives from the U.S., aiming to clarify market uncertainties, and China's strategic integration of Taiwan into economic discussions. The situation encompasses a dual structural conflict, with implications for U.S.-China relations and future trade negotiations, as well as the broader economic landscape influenced by various key variables and trends.

# News Comment
🧩 1. Event Identification

In April 2025, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated in an interview, “The U.S. will have ‘substantial clarity’ on tariff policies within the next 90 days.” This was seen as a signal to markets and allies to define trade uncertainty.

Meanwhile, the Chinese Foreign Ministry suggested future trade dialogues may involve the “Taiwan issue,” indicating that the “90-day clarity” also serves as a political countdown.

🔍 2. Motive Deconstruction

Bessent’s remarks and China’s Taiwan strategy reflect intertwined motivations:
1. U.S. Treasury: Fixing market uncertainties with a “90-day” statement.
2. Chinese Foreign System: Integrating Taiwan into economic talks as a strategic move.
3. White House: Asserting influence over tariff policies.

⸻

🧠 3. Structural Insight

The “Bessent Timeline” and “China-Taiwan Binding Strategy” reveal a dual structural conflict with:
- System Dimension: U.S. and Chinese logics.
- Policy Motive: Different mobilization strategies.
- External Stance: Pressure vs. stabilizing expectations.
- Market Management: Uncertainty and clarity restoration.
- Strategic Rhythm: Non-linear tactics and dual-track approaches.

Language acts as mechanism, topics as hedging assets, and time as negotiation trajectory.

💥 4. Key Variables

The “90-day clarity” hinges on six factors:
1. Will Trump support Bessent's statement?
2. Will U.S.-China negotiation frameworks restart?
3. Will China include Taiwan in talks?
4. The impact of inflation and U.S. elections.
5. Congressional proposals on tariffs.
6. Market interpretations of “clarity.”

📈 5. Trend Projection

Short-term (0–3 months): Treasury will provide “predictable language,” while China observes U.S. rhythms.

Mid-term (3–6 months): Taiwan's official trade agenda entry will shift discussions toward structural topics.

Long-term (6–12 months): The world will see a “dual structural split” between U.S. political systems and global economic frameworks, redefining trade negotiations.

🎯 LUMEN Summary

“90-day clarity” signals survival within the system. China’s integration of Taiwan into trade talks marks the start of overlapping civilizational boundaries.

From the LUMEN perspective:
• Bessent is the last “self-adjustment mechanism” in the structure.
• China uses topic binding as a countermeasure.
• The world approaches significant “language sovereignty” and “structural governance.”

This is not diplomacy; it is structural coding.
