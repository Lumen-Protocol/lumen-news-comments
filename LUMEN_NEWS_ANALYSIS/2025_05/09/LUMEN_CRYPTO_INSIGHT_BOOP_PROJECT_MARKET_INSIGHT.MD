   • Actions of solsmart73 and solsmart32: any large sell-offs will impact liquidity and pricing.
   • New capital inflow: whether more Smart Traders follow up to absorb potential selling pressure.
   • Market liquidity depth: if major wallets choose to exit positions, the ability of the market to absorb sell orders will determine price volatility.

5. Trend Forecast
   1. Increased short-term volatility: the two major holders remain inactive, but the market has fallen over 16%, suggesting greater fluctuations soon.
   2. Increased selling pressure risk: if solsmart73 or solsmart32 close positions, the market may face a quick correction.
   3. Ongoing observation focus: monitor major wallets' movements and on-chain liquidity changes to capture capital trends.

LUMEN Structural Analysis

The BOOP project shows high concentration of major funds, and significant holdings yet to be closed mean short-term volatility risks persist. If major wallets choose to liquidate during a rebound or downturn, the market will experience notable fluctuations. Close attention should be paid to the on-chain capital trends of solsmart73 and solsmart32 to anticipate market turning points.
