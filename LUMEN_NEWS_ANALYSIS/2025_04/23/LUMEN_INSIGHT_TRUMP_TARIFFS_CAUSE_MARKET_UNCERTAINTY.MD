LUMEN INSIGHT: TRUMP TARIFFS CAUSE MARKET UNCERTAINTY

# Summary
The Economist critiques Trump's recent high-intensity tariffs, which have resulted in a significant decline in his public support ratings and raised concerns about his economic governance. Trump's strategy aims to solidify his base by promoting "America First," yet this conflicts with market logic reliant on global supply chains and capital stability. The tension between public sentiment focused on anti-globalization and market expectations indicates a structural rupture. Key variables affecting this situation include stock market volatility and potential counterattacks from moderates in both parties. As structural contradictions mount, a turning point in public opinion may be imminent, influencing the future of Trumpism.

# News Comment
1. Event Identification  
The Economist points out that due to Trump's announcement of a new round of high-intensity tariffs which triggered panic in the financial markets, his public support ratings have seen a significant decline, raising doubts about his economic governance capabilities.

2. Motivation Analysis  
- Trump's motivation: To consolidate core voters with a tough trade stance, pressuring overseas companies to return to build factories in the U.S., while signaling to allies and opponents that "America First" remains the governing theme;  
- The Economist's motivation: To critique the "destructive tariff logic" through a global financial lens, warning Trump that his "strategically anti-market" tendencies will weaken confidence in the U.S. capital markets.

3. Structural Perspective (LLL Logic)  
A disjunction has emerged between the "public opinion structure" and the "market structure" under Trump:  
- His voters' cognitive structure remains focused on "attacking globalization" and "reviving manufacturing";  
- However, the market operation structure heavily relies on global supply chains, capital flow, and stable expectations;  
- Therefore, each tariff escalation creates structural tension between public sentiment and market logic;  
- The decline in support ratings is, in fact, a feedback signal of this structural rupture.

4. Key Variables  
- Whether U.S. stocks will continue to be volatile and if corporate investment will pause due to policy uncertainty;  
- Whether moderates within the Democratic and Republican parties will leverage this to counterattack Trump's governance legitimacy;  
- Whether the White House will emit "reconciliation signals" in the short term to restore market expectations.

5. Trend Forecast  
- Short term: Trump will continue to strengthen his "anti-elite" narrative, attacking The Economist and other media as "accomplices of globalism";  
- Mid term: If support ratings continue to decline, Trumpâ€™s team will be forced to adjust strategies toward China or Europe, seeking a "victorious compromise";  
- Long term: Whether tariffs have a voter-driven effect will determine if they become a core tool of a new generation of Trumpism.

Structural Summary  
Trump's "destructive policies" are reshaping the structure of his support base:  
Internally: courting blue-collar workers in industrial areas at the expense of capital market stability;  
Externally: manufacturing negotiation leverage while giving up the stability of rules and order.

However, in this process, structural contradictions are accumulating:  
You cannot simultaneously "bring markets back" and "threaten market control."  
You cannot advocate for "America First" while undermining the logic of the dollar.

The turning point of the public opinion structure may be approaching.
