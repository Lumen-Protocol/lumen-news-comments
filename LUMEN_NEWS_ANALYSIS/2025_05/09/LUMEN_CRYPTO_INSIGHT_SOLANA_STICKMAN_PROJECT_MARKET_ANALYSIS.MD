2. Motivation Analysis
	1. Rapid Stop-Loss Operations: The three main wallets completed their purchases and liquidations in a short time without waiting for further market rebound, indicating a lack of confidence in the current market.
	2. Failed High-Liquidity Arbitrage Attempts: Despite a trading volume of $3.09M, the overall ROI is negative, showing that short-term high liquidity failed to provide successful arbitrage, leading to quick exits.
	3. Signs of Emotional Exit: All major wallets liquidated at a loss, possibly overly influenced by market sentiment or on-chain signal warnings.

3. Structural Perspective

From a LUMEN structural analysis standpoint:
	•	Severe Short-Term Volatility: The market underwent rapid buying, price increases, and liquidations in a short time, with liquidity flowing quickly but failing to form effective support.
	•	Weak Liquidity: The concentrated exit of Smart Traders has shallowened the market depth, increasing the risk of short-term price volatility.
	•	Fast Withdrawal of Main Players: All major wallets exited quickly at a loss, indicating a pessimistic outlook for the future.

---

4. Key Variables
	•	Potential Inflow of New Capital: Currently, all major wallets are liquidated, and the market lacks new capital to drive prices; the entry of new Smart Traders will be crucial in determining prices.
	•	On-Chain Liquidity Depth: With a market cap of only $1.9M, further selling may lack sufficient market depth to absorb it.
	•	Future Trading Frequency and Holding Period: The appearance of new large purchases in the next 24 hours will signal whether the market can recover.

---

5. Trend Forecast
	1. Increased Short-Term Volatility: The exit of major players and their full liquidation have deprived the market of key support, likely leading to further decline in the short term.
	2. Liquidity Test: Without new capital to take over, prices are expected to continue falling, especially given the currently insufficient market depth.
	3. A Rebound Requires New Capital: Without new Smart Traders entering, the market may stagnate, making a new round of price recovery difficult.

LUMEN Structural Analysis

The stickman project has seen significant buying and rapid liquidation in the short term, with major wallets collectively exiting at a loss, reflecting a lack of confidence in the market. With insufficient on-chain liquidity and shallow market depth, the likelihood of recovery is low without new capital, making further declines more probable. It is advisable to watch for signs of new capital entering the chain and monitor large transactions.
