2. Motivation Analysis

From on-chain trading behavior:
1. Short-term arbitrage: solsmart74 completed buys and sells in a short time, achieving a high ROI of 102.31%, indicating high-frequency arbitrage intentions.
2. Volatility capture: solsmart60 still holds $10.1K, with only 1.65% ROI, showing expectation for further market increases.
3. Quick exit: solsmart63 traded frequently but exited at a loss, reflecting high-frequency testing of short-term fluctuations.

3. Structural Perspective

From LUMEN structural analysis:
- High volatility with evident arbitrage traces: The rapid high-yield exit by solsmart74 and solsmart63â€™s frequent trading demonstrate precise capture of short-term price fluctuations.
- Instability in holdings, lacking long-term capital: solsmart60 is the only wallet holding a position, with low ROI and no significant profit locking, indicating a lack of stable long-term funds.
- Abundant liquidity but severe volatility: The high-frequency trades and rapid exits by multiple Smart Traders show adequate liquidity yet an unstable market.

4. Key Variables
- Direction of solsmart60's holdings: A sell-off could apply significant selling pressure, leading to short-term price corrections.
- Continued inflow of new funds: Without new Smart Traders entering, it will be difficult for market prices to maintain current levels.
- Continuity of high-frequency trading: Whether solsmart63's frequent trading persists will impact short-term market volatility.
- Changes in on-chain liquidity pools: Large capital outflows could cause a rapid market correction in the short term.

5. Trend Prediction
1. Volatility may intensify in the short term: With solsmart60 still holding, if it does not choose to close positions, the market will retain some heat, but volatility will increase.
2. High sell-off risk: The profit exit by solsmart74 and quick tests by solsmart63 indicate strong short-term arbitrage tendencies, with selling pressure expected if no new funds engage.
3. Monitoring new capital inflows: The entry of new Smart Traders would alleviate short-term correction pressure; otherwise, maintaining current gains may be challenging.

LUMEN Structural Analysis

The SPLAT project shows typical characteristics of high volatility and short-term arbitrage, with multiple Smart Traders rapidly buying and selling, reflecting acute sensitivity to short-term fluctuations. solsmart60, as the only wallet not cleared, will indicate short-term market direction based on its holding decisions. Without continuous attraction of new buyers, significant short-term price correction risks exist. It is advisable to monitor the movements of large on-chain funds to assess potential for further upward momentum.
