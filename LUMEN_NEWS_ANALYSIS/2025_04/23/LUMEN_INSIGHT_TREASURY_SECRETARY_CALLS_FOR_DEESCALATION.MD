# News Comment
1. Event Identification  
U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent publicly called for mutual de-escalation between the U.S. and China in the trade war to prevent further escalation and harm to global financial markets and supply chain structures.

2. Motivation Analysis  
- Macroeconomic Motivation: Amid current inflation pressures and instability in debt markets in the U.S., tariff barriers exacerbate commodity prices and disrupt business expectations.  
- Political Motivation: Facing domestic electoral turbulence and lawsuits from states regarding tariff policies, the Treasury needs to issue rational statements to balance counter waves.  
- Capital Market Motivation: To avoid impacts on technology and energy stock valuations from trade tensions, stabilizing confidence in Wall Street and pension markets.

3. Structural Perspective (LLL)  
- Logical Layer: Bessent's statement emphasizes “mutual” responsibility, signaling a typical “symmetric concession structure.”  
- Language Layer: The use of “required” rather than “preferred” or “recommended” indicates that the administrative system has positioned “de-escalation” as a phased goal.  
- Power Layer: This statement is released amid rising pressures on multiple trade policies, aiming to re-establish the Treasury's policy leadership and balance the risk of presidential radical statements.

4. Key Variables  
- Whether China will respond to the condition of “reciprocal de-escalation” at the diplomatic or business ministry level;  
- Whether the divergence in the response of U.S. stock markets to signals from the Treasury and the White House will continue to widen;  
- Whether the White House will compensate for tariff concessions in other forms (e.g., agricultural subsidies or currency intervention);  
- Whether the Treasury will negotiate tariff concessions for financial structures like audit exemptions and data compliance for Chinese companies.

5. Trend Forecast  
- Short-term: The market will attempt to preemptively respond to price developments, factoring in potential easing expectations;  
- Mid-term: If China does not respond, the Treasury's statement may become an isolated voice within, leading to a market retracement;  
- Long-term: If the Treasury pushes for negotiation pathways in cooperation with the State Council and the Ministry of Commerce, it may initiate a “new structural dialogue” mechanism to replace the logic of a comprehensive trade war.

Structural Summary  
Scott Bessent’s statement represents the voice of the “structural calm faction” within the current Trump administration. It marks that:  
The fiscal system is attempting to reconstruct the balance of the trade war, shifting radical policies from punitive tariffs to a path of structural negotiation.  
However, if the White House and Congress continue to apply pressure, the rational logic of the fiscal system may still be suppressed by political logic. The key question remains: Will China provide a symmetrical response?
