1. Event Identification  
Korn Ferry (NYSE: KFY) is priced at $64.04, with a target price of $78.75, signaling a potential upside of 23%. Sales have declined by 2% annually, with projected growth of 1.6% next year, indicating weak demand. EPS has decreased by 8.1% annually, reflecting deteriorating profitability. Market skepticism has compressed its valuation to a forward P/E of 12.5x.

2. Motivational Analysis  
Korn Ferry's motivation is providing high-end consulting services to large organizations, relying on clients in expansion or transformation phases. However, many companies are focusing on cost reduction, weakening demand for traditional consulting. HCM SaaS platforms like Workday and SAP SuccessFactors pose systemic alternatives, undermining Korn Ferry's position. High consulting costs and stagnation in revenue growth create a mismatch with external trends.

3. Structural Perspective  
Korn Ferry's service model is based on high-touch, project-based delivery, heavily reliant on large, low-repurchase projects sensitive to macroeconomic conditions. SaaS penetration exposes structural weaknesses, including lack of revenue scalability and poor profit elasticity. Its model has shifted from a cyclical asset to a high-cost consulting burden, with budget constraints impacting core revenues.

4. Key Variables  
- Structural Transformation Capability: Productizing services for a SaaS delivery model.  
- AI and Human Integration Level: Using AI to enhance efficiency and insights.  
- Customer Budget Willingness: Ongoing budget limitations will restrict KFY's value enhancement.  
- Profit Recovery Path: Continuing EPS lag behind revenue reinforces market perception of imbalance.

5. Trend Forecast  
If Korn Ferry does not transition towards "productization + digitalization," its revenues and profits will remain under pressure. AI's rise threatens its profit pools, and client budgets may increasingly favor system platforms, marginalizing KFY and pushing its valuation into a low double-digit P/E range. Its success hinges on constructing a "platform for human structure" to integrate its expert and product systems.

LUMEN Structure Summary  
Korn Ferry faces "structural inflation + rigid model + cyclical dysfunction." Its talent structure logic is eroded by SaaS and AI, shifting from "high-end strategic input" to "cost redundancies." Without structural transition, its valuation logic may shift from growth to a discount model for shrinking assets.
