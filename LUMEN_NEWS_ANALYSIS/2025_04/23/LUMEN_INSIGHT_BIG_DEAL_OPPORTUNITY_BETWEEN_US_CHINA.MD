His comments aim to stabilize market expectations and create a positive framework for upcoming discussions without committing to specifics.

# News Comment
1. Event Identification  
U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated at the International Institute of Finance (IIF) annual meeting that there is a "big deal opportunity" for a significant agreement between China and the U.S. This statement is viewed as a positive signal amidst the current deadlock between the two sides.

2. Motivation Analysis  
• Demonstrating willingness to negotiate: As a key representative of the Trump administration's technological faction, Bessent's remarks signal an openness for dialogue;  
• Stabilizing market expectations: In the recent context of heightened sensitivity in financial markets regarding U.S.-China conflicts, he attempts to calm asset volatility with the notion of "possible cooperation";  
• Setting a psychological anchor for subsequent negotiations: By establishing a prelude of the “Big Deal” expectation, it aims to prevent the other side from low-balling proposals in future negotiations.

3. Structural Perspective (LLL Language Analysis)  
• Keyword Level:  
• opportunity → indicative of an expectation structure;  
• big deal → high-level structural label;  
• China-U.S. → clearly points to the bilateral strategic agenda;  
• Language Property: This is typical language of a structurally positive vague framework: No mention of timelines, mechanisms, or issue scope, but broadly suggesting "the opportunity exists," to maintain negotiation space.

4. Key Variables  
• Whether China responds through the Ministry of Commerce or Foreign Ministry (cooperation, observation, or denial);  
• Whether the U.S. takes substantive subsequent actions (such as exemptions on certain tariffs or restarting working groups);  
• Whether there are simultaneous cooperative topics in the economic realm (climate, AI regulation, financial service connectivity);  
• Whether market reactions to this statement result in rising Chinese concept stocks or a strengthening of trade concepts.

5. Trend Forecast  
• Short-Term: The U.S. and China may restart communication in a "sub-ministerial dialogue" format, but without urgency to form an agreement;  
• Mid-Term: The "Big Deal" framework established by Bessent is likely to become a standard template for future negotiation headlines;  
• Long-Term: The Trump administration may induce concessions from China in the areas of technology security and energy by initially offering olive branches and then setting exchange conditions.

Structural Summary  
Bessent did not announce an agreement, but rather presented a language template that suggests "an agreement is not being delayed, but is approaching."  

From a LUMEN structural perspective, this discourse belongs to a **"pre-set negotiation structure anchoring"**:  
Creating psychological space with vague yet positive high-frequency nouns (like big deal), maintaining flexibility by having a neutral official instead of the president speak, and avoiding bilateral awkwardness by addressing China in a global multilateral setting—this reflects the structural rationality in the diplomatic context of “synthetic ambiguity.”
