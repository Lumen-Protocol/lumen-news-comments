2. Motivation Analysis

From on-chain trading behavior:
1. High loss positions: solsmart47 has nearly 90% loss after holding for close to a day but has not closed the position, possibly expecting a short-term rebound.
2. Quick liquidation to stop loss: solsmart3 and solsmart32 completed buying and selling within a day, showing an avoidance of the downward trend.
3. Bearish market sentiment: Despite significant purchases, rapid liquidations suggest a lack of optimism about the project's future.

3. Structural Perspective

From the LUMEN structural analysis perspective:
- Capital concentration is dispersed: No significant whales are locking in positions, making it hard to form strong support in the short term.
- Quick stop-loss strategy is evident: The liquidated solsmart3 and solsmart32 show rapid reactions to volatility risks.
- Market pressure is evident: Significant drops in a short time indicate liquidity issues, leading to increased price volatility.

---

4. Key Variables
- Subsequent actions of solsmart47: If it continues to hold and waits for a rebound, prices might stabilize; if it chooses to stop loss, further dips may occur.
- New capital inflow situation: Without new large-scale capital entering, the market will remain under pressure.
- Changes in on-chain liquidity pools: Monitor if liquidity declines due to large sell orders, causing more drastic fluctuations.

5. Trend Predictions
1. Prices may continue to dip in the short term: Wallets that quickly liquidated did not choose to wait, indicating a lack of market confidence.
2. The position of solsmart47 is crucial: A stop loss here could trigger a second drop; continuing to hold could indicate waiting for higher price rebounds.
3. Increased liquidity risk: Without new buying support, liquidity may not be sufficient to support price recovery.

LUMEN structural analysis

The FTJ project currently shows significant bearish pressure; despite large purchases, the behavior of rapid liquidation indicates a lack of confidence in the market's future. On-chain trading shows increased liquidity risks, and if no new capital enters, prices will continue to be under pressure. It is recommended to continuously monitor the movements of solsmart47's position and the flow of large on-chain funds to assess the market's future direction.
