1. Event Identification  
Mondelez (NASDAQ: MDLZ) released its Q1 2025 financial report, with overall revenue stable but a significant decline in profit margins, highlighting the severe erosion of profitability due to cost pressures. Key data includes: revenue of $9.31 billion, meeting market expectations; adjusted EPS of $0.74, exceeding expectations by 12.2%; however, adjusted EBITDA was only $1 billion, far below the market expectation of $1.54 billion, missing by 34.7%. Operating profit margin plummeted from 29.4% to 7.3%, and free cash flow margin decreased to 8.8%. Organic revenue grew 3.1% year-on-year, but sales fell 3.5%. The company’s current market value is approximately $84.3 billion.

2. Motivation Analysis  
In the face of high raw material costs (especially cocoa) and weak consumer demand, the company has raised product prices to stabilize revenue, but this has led to continued sales decline. Its short-term motivation is to prevent revenue collapse and maintain its standing in the capital market; long-term is to leverage brand influence to increase unit value, but it has not effectively translated into profit recovery.

3. Structural Perspective  
Mondelez exhibits a typical structural contradiction of "price increase to maintain revenue, with profit getting squeezed." Despite stabilizing revenue, the drastic decline in EBITDA shows that the pricing strategy has not fully covered cost impacts, particularly regarding raw materials and transportation costs in a high-inflation environment. Popular products in the portfolio are highly price-sensitive, creating a lose-lose scenario for price and sales; the structural leverage effect has failed, leading to an overall shrinkage in margins.

4. Key Variables  
- Fluctuations in cocoa and sugar raw material prices will directly affect future profit elasticity;  
- Consumer tolerance for ongoing price increases will determine whether organic growth can be sustained;  
- The brand’s competitive edge against substitutes;  
- Speed of cost structure optimization and supply chain collaboration improvements.

5. Trend Forecast  
If raw material prices remain high and the company continues to rely on price increases to stabilize revenue, the decline in sales will worsen, resulting in further deterioration of profitability. In the medium term, Mondelez may need to rely on layoffs, SKU rationalization, and operational expense reductions to restore EBITDA elasticity. Until the structural imbalance is resolved, valuation will depend more on cash flow stability rather than growth potential.

LUMEN Structural Summary:  
Mondelez is in a structural compression phase: rising cost rigidity on one side and revenue at the pricing limit on the other, creating a tension of "stable income - profit loss." Its business model is shifting from "strong brand driving profitability" to "strong brand delaying decline," and its valuation will be re-priced around the logic of low growth, high brand strength, but weak profit elasticity.
