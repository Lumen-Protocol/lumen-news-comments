LUMEN INSIGHT: GOLDEN VISAS TURN NATIONALITY INTO COMMODITY

# Summary
The Trump administration's proposal to increase the threshold for "golden visas" reflects a significant shift towards the commodification of nationality by transforming immigration into a pricing mechanism for affluent individuals. This policy aligns with the administration's business-oriented governance philosophy, positioning American nationality as a marketable asset. While high-net-worth individuals from unstable regions may view the U.S. as a lucrative safe haven, opponents criticize the notion that citizenship can be purchased. This trend raises concerns about immigration inequality, as financial capacity dictates access, potentially reshaping the identity and value of American citizenship in the global context.

# News Comment
1. Incident Identification

The Economist highlights that the Trump administration plans to raise the threshold price for "golden visas" (i.e., permanent U.S. residency in exchange for capital investment), sparking a new round of controversy over the "commodification of nationality." This policy indicates that the U.S. is accelerating the transformation of its immigration system into a pricing mechanism for high-net-worth individuals, with Trump reshaping the market expression of national sovereignty through this "nationality valuation."

2. Motive Analysis
   • Trump Administration: This move aligns with its governance philosophy of "America as a business." The price increase for golden visas not only generates direct revenue but also symbolizes the commercial logic that "American nationality has a price."
   • High-Net-Worth Individuals (especially in Asia and the Middle East): There is an increasing demand for alternative identity solutions, particularly in the context of rising global instability, as the U.S. remains a "safe haven asset."
   • Opponents: Progressives, immigrant rights organizations, and some establishment conservatives argue that nationality should reflect political participation and cultural belonging rather than purely an investment gateway.
   • State Governments: Particularly those reliant on real estate may secretly support this move as it aids capital inflow and supports asset prices.

3. Structural Perspective
   • Financialization of National Sovereignty: Nationality is "repackaged" as an asset class, with the government becoming an "identity issuer," and immigration policy morphing into a "quasi-asset management" tool.
   • Restructured State-Capital Relations: It shows that rather than "capital obeying the state," "the state creates mechanisms for capital," with golden visas symbolizing sovereignty yielding to liquidity.
   • Re-manufacturing of Identity Structures: Lower-tier immigrants face border restrictions and scrutiny, while top-tier capital can "pay to skip the line," highlighting an accelerating "immigration inequality mechanism."
   • Consistency in Trump's Governance Logic: Whether "government is a business" or "the state is a brand," it points to a core logic—that America is not a community, but a high-value asset.

4. Key Variables
   • The magnitude of adjustment to golden visa prices and specific threshold amounts.
   • The response of the global high-net-worth population (especially in the Middle East and Southeast Asia).
   • Whether the Senate proposes opposing or amending bills.
   • Whether states will launch independent investment attraction plans around this policy.
   • Whether it triggers "follow-up imitation" in other countries, creating a price war in the immigration market.

5. Trend Forecast
   • Short-term (Q2-Q3 2025): Golden visa prices will rise, and some real estate projects will be packaged with the new visa scheme, with capital intermediaries quickly following suit.
   • Mid-term (by the end of 2025): Democratic states or left-wing media may initiate a moral debate, questioning the legitimacy of "buying citizenship."
   • Long-term (2026-2027): Golden visas may become a new geopolitical tool for the U.S.—exchanging immigration quotas for technology investments, diplomatic concessions, or even political commitments.

Structural Summary

Trump is not devaluing nationality; he is creating a market for it.

Not everyone can immigrate, but all assets can vote.

When "becoming an American" is no longer about belief, culture, language, or constitution, but a string of bank numbers—you will find that America is no longer a country, but an identity asset awaiting valuation in an IPO.

Golden visas do not just grant you a green card; they provide a valuation for America.
