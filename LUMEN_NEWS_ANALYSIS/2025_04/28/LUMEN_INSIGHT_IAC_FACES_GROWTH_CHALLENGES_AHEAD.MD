1. Event Recognition  
IAC (NASDAQ: IAC) is a digital platform operating company managing brands such as Dotdash Meredith, Angi, and Care.com, currently with a forward P/E ratio of 16. According to recent analyses, IAC faces significant operational risks, including declining annual sales, a sharp drop in earnings per share (EPS), and worsening capital return rates.

2. Motivation Analysis  
IAC continues to rely primarily on acquisitions and integration for expansion, aiming to build a moat against single market fluctuations through scaled and diversified platform arrangements. At the same time, the company seeks to enhance cash flow and profit margins through mergers and acquisitions to support ongoing capital market financing and investor return expectations.

3. Structural Perspective  
IAC's fundamental structure is driven by a growth model focused on continuous acquisitions and incubation. However, current data reveals typical cyclical fatigue characteristics: new acquisitions fail to drive effective revenue expansion; the efficiency of integrating existing assets declines; resources are diluted across multiple platforms, leading to a systematic deterioration in capital return rates and structural loss of shareholder value.

4. Key Variables  
- Recovery of revenue in core business segments determines overall cash flow stability.  
- The pace and extent of EPS recovery is critical for the market to reassess valuation premiums.  
- Whether the return on invested capital (ROIC) can turn positive indicates the effectiveness of resource allocation.  
- The pace of recovery in the advertising market within the macroeconomic environment will directly impact revenue elasticity across platforms.

5. Trend Forecast  
If IAC cannot quickly improve asset efficiency and profitability within the next 1-2 years, it will continue to face valuation compression, stagnant stock prices, and further loss of capital market support. If management can promptly execute strategic retrenchment, dispose of inefficient assets, and focus on high-return areas, there may be a possibility to stabilize. However, the overall window of opportunity is limited, and risks remain tilted downward.

LUMEN Structural Summary:  
IAC exhibits a typical deterioration path of "out-of-control scale expansion—profit collapse—capital efficiency degradation" in its acquisition-driven organizational structure. In the current cycle of reduced capital market risk appetite, without clear restructuring or strategic corrective actions, IAC is highly likely to enter a long-term trajectory of continuous value erosion.
