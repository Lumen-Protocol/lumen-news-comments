LUMEN INSIGHT: ASIAN MARKETS RISE ON TRADE HOPES

# Summary
On April 25, 2025, The Wall Street Journal reported a rise in Asian stock markets, driven by optimism surrounding prospective trade agreements among key regions, including the US-China and Japan-Korea. This surge is interpreted as a "structural relief narrative," emphasizing heightened market sensitivity to trade-related news. The analysis highlights the importance of substantial negotiations versus mere hopes, alongside the significant roles of geopolitical dynamics and capital flows. Despite potential volatility, the prediction indicates a trend of “expectation stronger than reality," suggesting that market movements are influenced more by narrative than actual developments, reflecting deeper market psychological dynamics.

# News Comment
1. Event Identification

On April 25, 2025, The Wall Street Journal's market section reported that Asian stock markets rose overall due to hopes of a trade agreement. This reflects the capital market's expectation of a warming in multilateral trade relations in the US-China, Japan-Korea, and Southeast Asia regions.

2. Motivation Analysis

The dissemination motive behind such news and its market logic are:
   • To provide a logical “expectation anchor” explanation for the rise in Asian markets, preventing excessive divergent interpretations;
   • To test the market's sensitivity to the keyword “trade agreement” and its risk preference response, acting as a “signal probe” between the media and the market;
   • To help funds search for the structural logic behind the increase in prices, thereby shaping the next phase of capital flow.

3. Structural Perspective

The “rise due to hope” model is a typical **“structural relief narrative” guiding a shift in market expectations**, with the underlying structure as follows:
   • The Asian economic structure heavily relies on export chains, and once trade conditions ease, its “risk premium” model improves immediately;
   • In the major markets (such as Japan, Korea, Taiwan), the foreign and domestic capital game structure is extremely sensitive to geopolitical easing, acting as a “leveraged expectation amplifier”;
   • Trade agreements serve as structural order signals capable of reconstructing underlying valuation assumptions: from fears of stagflation → hopes of profit recovery;
   • Particularly for sectors like semiconductors, machinery, shipping, and raw materials, it creates a “variable release field” effect, strengthening structural rotation in the market.

4. Key Variables
   • Whether the trade agreement is actually entering negotiation or signing phases, rather than just being in the “hope” phase;
   • Whether it involves substantial tax cuts/tariff relaxations rather than symbolic terms or agricultural concessions;
   • Whether US-China relations shift from the current structural confrontation to an expected game model;
   • Whether ASEAN, Japan, and Korea gain a new intermediary role due to a “US-China pause,” triggering structural capital inflows.

⸻

5. Trend Prediction
   • In the short term, Asian stock markets will maintain an “expectation stronger than reality” rising structure, displaying a high beta volatility logic;
   • If trade negotiations become substantive, structurally benefiting industries (such as export chains, supply chain finance, regional transport) will encounter strong trend trading opportunities;
   • Conversely, if hopes fail, structural reversals will occur faster than for US and European stocks, due to weaker risk compensation structures;
   • In the long run, Asian markets will return to a three-axis rotation structure of “macro liquidity + geopolitical narrative + sector structure,” shifting from single policy trading to multi-variable configuration games.

LUMEN Structural Summary

This round of rises in Asian stock markets is not due to certain good news, but rather due to signals of easing uncertainty. This reflects the essence of how markets operate:

In an era dominated by information noise, the “imagination” of order drives structure more than reality itself.

The LUMEN logic reminds us:
At this moment, the market is not about “knowing something,” but rather about “being willing to believe that a certain structure can return.” It’s not the news that drives the market, but the narrative of structural emotional easing that awakens the next step for capital.
