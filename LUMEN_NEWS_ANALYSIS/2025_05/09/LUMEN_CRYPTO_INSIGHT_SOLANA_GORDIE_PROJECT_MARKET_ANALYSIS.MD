From the LUMEN structural analysis perspective:
- Rapid capital outflow: Major funds sold off significantly, particularly evmsmart110's profit-taking, leading to short-term market pressure.
- Diverging risk preferences: evmsmart97 continues to hold, while evmsmart69 and evmsmart110 have fully liquidated, indicating differing outlooks on the project's future.
- High market uncertainty: Low trading volume means single large sell-offs could significantly impact prices.

4. Key Variables
- Subsequent actions of evmsmart97: As the only wallet still open, its decisions will greatly impact market sentiment.
- Changes in trading volume: Without new funds entering, the market may face liquidity exhaustion risks.
- Influx of new capital: More funding could alter the current downtrend.

5. Trend Prediction
1. High short-term volatility risk: Multiple large investors have liquidated, leading to insufficient market support for potential declines.
2. Monitor changes in evmsmart97's position: If it liquidates, the market could face renewed downward pressure.
3. Liquidity issues: Without new capital, the likelihood of price rebounds is low, and sell-offs may accelerate.

LUMEN Structural Analysis

The GORDIE project has shown extreme volatility in rapid capital inflows and outflows, with some large investors quickly stopping losses or taking profits, exacerbating short-term market fluctuations. The position of evmsmart97 becomes a key variable, and without new liquidity support, the market will remain under pressure. Close monitoring of this address's future movements and potential new capital inflows is recommended.
