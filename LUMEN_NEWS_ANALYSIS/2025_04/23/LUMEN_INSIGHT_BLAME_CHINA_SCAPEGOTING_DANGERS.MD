LUMEN INSIGHT: BLAME CHINA SCAPEGOTING DANGERS

# Summary
Economic commentator Peter Schiff has criticized U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent for attributing structural issues in the U.S. economy to China, citing accusations related to savings and consumption patterns. Schiff argues that this scapegoating approach is harmful and detracts from constructive solutions, threatening U.S.-China cooperation. He identifies underlying tensions between the differing economic models of the two nations and highlights the dangers of political blame logic overshadowing necessary structural reforms. Moving forward, scrutinizing domestic governance rather than externalizing blame on China could be essential for addressing economic challenges and fostering mutual trust between the nations.

1. Incident Identification  
Economic commentator Peter Schiff criticized U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent for blaming several structural issues in the U.S. economy on China during public discussions. He listed four typical lines of accusation: low U.S. savings rate → blame high Chinese savings; excessive U.S. consumption → blame Chinese thrift; insufficient U.S. production capacity → blame Chinese surplus; low U.S. capital investment → blame excessive Chinese investment. Schiff believes this scapegoating logic is dangerous, lacking in constructive solutions, and may anger China, undermining the foundation for cooperation.

2. Motivation Analysis  
Bessent's remarks, stemming from the current tense U.S.-China trade and investment environment, are motivated by:  
• Domestic economic responsibility shifting: External attribution can effectively divert attention and shape a narrative of "America being deprived" under economic restructuring and electoral pressures.  
• Justifying the "decoupling-reindustrialization" strategy: Framing China as the source helps legitimize policies like manufacturing repatriation, tech containment, and capital restrictions.  
• "Linguistic sanctions" amid limited administrative tools: Faced with weak internal finances and structural inefficiencies, Bessent opts for a discourse that conveys deterrence and assigns blame.

3. Structural Perspective  
Schiff's criticism highlights several structural tensions in the U.S.-China economic comparison:  
• Domestic demand model vs. investment model: The U.S. relies on consumption while China focuses on investment and exports.  
• High consumption society vs. high savings society: American households maintain their living standards through credit, while Chinese families tend to save more due to lack of security.  
• Deindustrialization vs. strong manufacturing: The U.S. has long faced manufacturing hollowing out, whereas China plays a core role in high-end manufacturing and supply chains.  
• Political blame logic vs. economic system logic: The U.S. political sphere tends to attribute blame using value-based reasoning (blaming China) while overlooking institutional evolution and the lag in industrial policy.

4. Key Variables  
• Intensity of U.S.-China public opinion interaction: Whether China will explicitly counter Bessent's remarks through official or semi-official channels.  
• U.S. domestic policy orientation: Whether to continue promoting decoupling policies or a new round of tariffs based on "China blame."  
• Voter acceptance of the blame logic: If "external attribution" resonates with the middle class, this logic may persist through election cycles.  
• Market feedback: Whether businesses perceive this rhetoric as signaling radical policy changes, prompting early adjustments to China cooperation and supply chain structures.

5. Trend Predictions  
In the short term, the rhetoric that "China is a structural scapegoat" will be frequently employed among U.S. politicians and economic managers as a convenient explanation for weak domestic demand, sluggish manufacturing, and uncontrolled deficits. In the long term, if the U.S. fails to improve fiscal execution efficiency and industrial investment capacity, this blame discourse will gradually be undermined by market and social realities. The mutual trust foundation between China and the U.S. will also be continuously eroded by "scapegoating communication."

Structural Summary  
Schiff's criticism essentially points out that blame logic cannot replace structural reform; using China's savings rate as an excuse for U.S. consumption failure is an illusion that evades governance challenges. The real adversaries are not China's thrift and capacity, but rather America’s fiscal discipline, manufacturing resolve, and administrative efficiency. The louder a country's external attribution becomes, the more its internal governance capabilities need to be scrutinized. Viewing China as a mirror rather than a scapegoat may be the starting point for escaping structural dilemmas.
