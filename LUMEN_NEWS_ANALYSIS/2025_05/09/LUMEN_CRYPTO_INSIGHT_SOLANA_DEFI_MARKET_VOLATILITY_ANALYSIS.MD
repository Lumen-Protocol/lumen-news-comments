3. Structural Insight

From the perspective of LUMEN structure analysis:
   • Weak liquidity: Total trading volume only $35.68K, major funds exit quickly, with most choosing to clear.
   • High-risk speculation: DeFi projects are marked as high-risk, with major funds not opting for long-term holding but rather short-term trades.
   • Structural volatility risk: solsmart34's position remains unchanged; future sell-offs could further pressure the market.

⸻

4. Key Variables
   • Follow-up actions of solsmart34: Whether to continue holding or to clear will directly affect market sentiment.
   • Fund inflow situation: Without new funds entering, the current holders' sell-off will cause further price decline.
   • Changes in market sentiment: If more Smart Traders choose to exit, it will exacerbate the price downtrend.

5. Trend Forecast
   1. Short-term volatility increase: Most major funds are clearing and exiting, leading to weak market liquidity, making it prone to sell-offs.
   2. Significant pullback pressure: If solsmart34's heavy holding does not exit profitably, it will continue to suppress prices.
   3. Focus on liquidity pool changes: In cases of insufficient market depth, small sell pressure can trigger significant fluctuations.

LUMEN Structure Analysis

Currently, Solana’s DeFi projects exhibit high volatility and risk characteristics, with major funds mostly completing short-term trades, leading to insufficient funding support in the market. The holding of solsmart34 is the only major open position; if a timely stop-loss is not executed, it will create ongoing pressure on the market. It is advisable to monitor its subsequent moves and whether new liquidity is injected to alleviate selling pressure.
