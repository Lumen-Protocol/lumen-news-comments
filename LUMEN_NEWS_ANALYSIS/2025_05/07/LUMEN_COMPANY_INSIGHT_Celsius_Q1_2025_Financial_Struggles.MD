2. Motivation Analysis  
Celsius's decline in performance is primarily due to weakened market demand and rising costs. As a functional beverage supplier, Celsius faces higher raw material costs and supply chain pressure, combined with slowing demand for functional beverages, resulting in revenue shortfalls. Additionally, the decline in EBITDA and EPS reflects imbalances in cost management and market expansion. The significant drop in operating profit margin (23.4% â†’ 15.8%) further indicates issues with internal operational efficiency.

3. Structural Insight  
From Celsius's financial structure, the following points are crucial:  
1. Revenue decline and misses expectations: A year-on-year drop of 7.4% suggests market saturation and stalled sales growth.  
2. Significant margin decline: The drop from 23.4% to 15.8% indicates increased cost pressure and intensified market competition.  
3. Contraction in free cash flow and EBITDA: Falling short of market expectations shows issues in cost control and profit conversion.  
4. Market share threat: If competitors expand in the functional beverage sector, Celsius's market position could be impacted.  

These structural issues highlight Celsius's weaknesses in supply chain management, cost control, and market expansion, as well as the fragility of its revenue and profitability.

4. Key Variables  
- Global growth rate of functional beverages: Future market expansion will directly impact Celsius's revenue performance.  
- Cost management and supply chain optimization: Without effective cost reduction and supply chain efficiency improvements, profit margins may remain under pressure.  
- Product diversification and brand penetration: Success in breaking into new markets will determine mid-term performance.  
- Intensifying market competition: Competitive pressure from giants like Monster and Red Bull will affect market share.

5. Trend Forecast  
In the short term, Celsius's cost pressures and declining margins will continue to affect its stock performance, shaking market confidence in its growth potential. In the mid term, if the company strengthens cost control, optimizes supply chains, and expands market share, it may regain growth momentum. Long-term, the expansion of the functional beverage market and rising consumer health awareness will be potential growth drivers, but the key lies in enhancing internal management efficiency.

LUMEN Structural Summary  
Celsius's financial report reveals dual issues of cost pressure and limited market expansion. Future stabilization of profit margins and market share improvement will be critical to determining its value recovery. The company must also accelerate supply chain and market strategy optimizations to withstand competitive pressures.
