3. Structural Insight

From the perspective of LUMEN structure analysis:
	•	Poor liquidity: With a trading volume of only $162.99K, it's hard to support larger fund movements.
	•	Signs of quick exit: The rapid liquidation of evmsmart55 and evmsmart97 shows a lack of optimism about the project’s future.
	•	Single wallet risk dominance: evmsmart63's holding becomes key for short-term fluctuations; any selling could create market pressure.

⸻

4. Key Variables
	•	Decision on evmsmart63’s position: If it decides to liquidate, the market may quickly decline.
	•	Volume expansion: Without new liquidity, the market will stay in low liquidity fluctuations.
	•	Potential for new large buy orders: Without new funds entering, an effective rebound is hard to achieve in the short term.

5. Trend Prediction
	1.	Short-term downward volatility: Liquidation actions and high loss rates among holders reveal insufficient confidence.
	2.	Waiting funds are not entering: The market lacks confidence for a rebound, with no significant volume increase.
	3.	Increasing liquidity risk: If evmsmart63 opts to sell, the market will decline rapidly.

LUMEN Structure Analysis

The BIDEN project currently experiences low liquidity with some large holders exiting quickly. The existing position of evmsmart63 becomes critical for short-term price fluctuations, as its changes will directly impact market stability. Currently, capital hasn’t significantly increased; without new large buy orders, effective upward momentum is hard to achieve in the short term. It is recommended to monitor liquidity changes and the movements of large on-chain capital.
