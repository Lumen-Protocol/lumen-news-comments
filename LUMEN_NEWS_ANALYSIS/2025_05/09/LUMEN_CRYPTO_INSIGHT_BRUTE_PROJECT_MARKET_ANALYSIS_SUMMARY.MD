2. Motivation Analysis

From on-chain trading behavior:
   1. Quick stop-loss actions: solsmart45 and solsmart7 rapidly liquidated amid significant losses, indicating cautious sentiment towards the project's future.
   2. Holding positions to observe: solsmart72 maintained part of its position after multiple buys, signaling optimistic short-term rebound expectations, with no liquidation actions.
   3. Short-term speculative buys: Overall transaction volume is low, and wallet actions are relatively fast, suggesting dominant speculative behavior in the market.

3. Structural Insight

From the LUMEN structural analysis perspective:
   • Lack of liquidity: Trading volume is low relative to market cap, with funds not flowing efficiently.
   • Quick exit signals: The rapid liquidations by solsmart45 and solsmart7 indicate that large holders are not optimistic about the project's sustainable growth.
   • Individual wallet gambling: Solsmart72's higher holding amount may impact liquidity and price significantly if it decides to liquidate.

---

4. Key Variables
   • Changes in solsmart72's holdings: Whether to continue holding or liquidate will directly affect short-term market price fluctuations.
   • Changes in trading volume: Without significant increases in trading volume, the market will continue to show low liquidity, affecting buying and selling depth.
   • New large capital injections: With slow fund movement currently, the price may continue to drop without new large capital inflows.

---

5. Trend Prediction
   1. Short-term decline likely: The frequent stop-loss actions from large holders reveal a clear lack of market confidence.
   2. Single wallet-driven risk: solsmart72 still holds considerable BRUTE; if it decides to sell, there will be short-term downward pressure.
   3. Liquidity dependency on new funds: Without new capital inflows, it will be difficult to boost the market, and prices may remain under pressure.

LUMEN Structural Analysis

The BRUTE project is currently experiencing liquidity scarcity and exits by large holders, with insufficient short-term capital inflows to trigger significant price increases. The quick liquidations by major traders indicate a cautious market sentiment, and solsmart72's holdings will determine short-term price movements. Without external funding support, BRUTE may continue to adjust downward. It is advised to monitor fund movements and changes in on-chain liquidity.
