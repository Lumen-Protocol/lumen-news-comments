2. Motivational Analysis
   1. Short-term arbitrage failure: solsmart30 and solsmart7 completed buying and liquidating quickly, both showing negative ROI, indicating unsuccessful short-term arbitrage strategies.
   2. Wait-and-see strategy: solsmart35 has not completely liquidated and still holds a balance of $2.48K, possibly waiting for a market rebound.
   3. Rapid capital withdrawal: Quick exits after large buys indicate a lack of confidence in the project's short-term performance.

⸻

3. Structural Perspective

From the perspective of LUMEN structure analysis:
   • High capital liquidity: Large capital inflow and outflow in a short time indicate strong market speculation.
   • Single-held positions: solsmart35 is the only wallet still holding a position, and the amount is relatively small, suggesting insufficient market stability.
   • Liquidity shortage: Current market trading volume is below $200K, large trades significantly impact prices.

⸻

4. Key Variables
   • solsmart35’s holding operations: whether it will liquidate within a short term is a key signal for price fluctuations.
   • New capital entry situation: without more buys, the project price may drop further.
   • Changes in trading frequency: observe if new Smart Traders join, which will influence market direction.

⸻

5. Trend Prediction
   1. Continued short-term downward pressure: two major players have not replenished after liquidation, indicating strong market selling pressure.
   2. High liquidity risk: current liquidity is insufficient; without new capital, the recovery potential is low.
   3. Strong wait-and-see sentiment: after rapid capital withdrawal, market sentiment is cautious; new capital entry will be a key turning point.

LUMEN Structure Analysis

The COM project shows characteristics of fast capital inflow and outflow for arbitrage in the short term. The main wallets solsmart30 and solsmart7 quickly exited at a loss, while only solsmart35 maintains a small position, indicating a cautious market attitude. Future price direction depends on new capital injection and liquidity improvement; otherwise, it will continue to face downward pressure. Continuous observation of liquidity pool changes and large on-chain transfers is recommended to capture market trends.
