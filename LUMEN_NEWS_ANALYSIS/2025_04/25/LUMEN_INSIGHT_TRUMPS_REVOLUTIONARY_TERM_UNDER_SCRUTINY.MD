# News Comment
1. Event Recognition

On April 25, 2025, The Economist's social media released its latest cover feature, commenting on the "high-intensity" first 100 days of Trump's second term, labeling him as "the most influential president of the century," even comparing him to Roosevelt. The cover illustration depicts a battered, bandaged bald eagle (symbolizing America) with the title: "Trump is a revolutionary. Will he succeed?"

2. Motivation Analysis

This report and its dissemination are not merely news presentations but acts of public opinion construction with multiple motivations:
   - Historical Comparison: By paralleling Trump with Roosevelt, it emphasizes that he is not a "normal president" but an agent redefining the system, guiding readers from policy observation to historical judgment.
   - Rhetoric of Warning with Change Potential: It stresses "injury" and "no going back" while creating suspense with "will the revolutionary succeed," leaving room for future explanations of policy legitimacy, showcasing an elite media strategy that is critical yet not entirely dismissive.
   - Activating Consensus on "Irreversible Change in America": The cover addresses the global English media sphere, sowing the preconception in the US-European intellectual community that "Trump will reconstruct the international order."

3. Structural Perspective

The structure of this issue of The Economist is a trinity of "symbolic language + visual anxiety + institutional suspense":
   - Symbolic Language: The use of "revolutionary" and "no going back" constructs an ultimate narrative focusing on "irreversibility and costs" rather than "right or wrong."
   - Visual Anxiety: The image of the injured bald eagle symbolizes the fragility of the state as an institutional machine, implying that while change may be strong, the process could tear at the fabric of constitutional order.
   - Institutional Suspense Structure: Ending with "Will he succeed?" does not provide a conclusion but sets a framework for questioning, guiding the elite class to engage in structural divergent judgments.

4. Key Variables
   - Whether Congress and the judiciary will provide structural pushback or institutional resistance to his "transformational executive actions";
   - Whether civil society, especially the middle class and youth, will accept the view of "this is the structure of the new era," or plan for resistance or alternatives;
   - Whether the Democratic Party can propose an alternative governance vision that effectively competes with the "revolutionary narrative," rather than merely moral criticism;
   - Whether the international community, especially the EU and APAC, will transform "the unpredictability of American governance" into diplomatic decoupling or the establishment of independent discourse systems.

5. Trend Forecast

The Economist's cover symbolizes a clear signal: the world is beginning to accept the reality of "the structural success of Trumpism" and is starting to discuss the consequences rather than attempting to deny its legitimacy. This structural cognitive shift will bring the following trends:
   - The internal political structure of the U.S. will enter a "legitimacy collision period," with tensions between the constitution and authoritarian figures continuing to escalate;
   - The discourse structure of elite media will shift from "crisis warning" to "order restructuring negotiation," attempting to influence the design of the post-revolution order;
   - The global governance system will enter a "post-consensus era," with the previously Western-dominated rules facing gradual renegotiation;
   - The symbolic language of "injured but still functioning" indicates that America will become a global model for a major power operating under a "limited constitutional state."

This eagle image serves not just as a portrait of a nation but may also foreshadow an early obituary for the "death of the old order."
