LUMEN INSIGHT: SUPPLY SHORTAGE WARNINGS SIGNAL CONFLICT

# Summary
On April 25, 2025, U.S. companies cautioned that a failure to reach a temporary truce in the U.S.-China trade war could lead to significant supply shortages akin to those experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic. This warning aims to prompt policymakers to consider the implications of tariffs while managing consumer expectations and potential price increases. The companies' concerns reflect deeper tensions between multinational interests and national policies, highlighting China's critical role in supply chains. Without easing tensions, the market may face pandemic-like shortages, prompting businesses to stockpile and consumers to hoard essentials, intensifying the economic cold war.

# News Comment
1. Incident Recognition

On April 25, 2025, MarketWatch reported that U.S. companies warned that if a temporary truce is not reached in the trade war with China, it could trigger supply shortages similar to those seen during the COVID-19 pandemic, affecting consumer electronics, medical supplies, clothing fibers, automotive parts, and food additives.

2. Motivation Analysis

Companies issued this warning to influence policy:
   • Voice of business interests: In response to the Trump administration’s tariffs, they aim to force policymakers to address short-term costs and voter reactions.
   • Preemptive justification for potential supply disruptions: They want to attribute any future sales declines or price increases to "institutional conflicts."
   • Activate consumer expectation management: By warning consumers of potential shortages and price hikes, they hope to mitigate brand trust issues.

3. Structural Perspective

This statement reveals the tension between multinational capital and national strategies:
   • The impact of supply chain disruptions primarily affects consumer livelihoods, not foreign trade accounts.
   • Activating public memories of pandemic shortages rekindles anxieties about past crises.
   • There’s an acknowledgment of China’s "irreplaceability" in the supply chain, indicating no feasible alternatives in the short term.

4. Key Variables
   • Possibility of a cooling agreement between the U.S. and China.
   • Introduction of "buffer exemption policies" by the U.S. government.
   • China's potential low-profile countermeasures against U.S. categories.
   • Market response to the prospect of "pandemic-level shortages."

5. Trend Forecast

If U.S.-China tensions do not ease, we could see a resurgence of pandemic-era supply-demand mismatches:
   • Companies may stockpile and diversify supply investments, increasing costs.
   • Consumers might engage in "precautionary hoarding," driving up essential prices.
   • Focus will shift to supply chain management as core to corporate governance.
   • The use of supply chains as diplomatic tools will reinforce the economic cold war perspective.

In summary, the "shortage warning" signals structural conflict affecting consumers, reframing the geopolitical issue into whether shelves will be empty.
