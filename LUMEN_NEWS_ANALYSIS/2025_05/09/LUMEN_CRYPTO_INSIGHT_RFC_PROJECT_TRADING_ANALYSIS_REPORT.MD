3. Structure Insight

From the perspective of LUMEN structure analysis:
- Significant high-frequency short-term strategy: Frequent buying and selling followed by rapid liquidation shows high sensitivity to liquidity.
- Noticeable concentration: @xiaomucyr…'s $18.39K holding represents a large portion; any liquidation may cause liquidity fluctuations.
- Trading depth and market sentiment: A large number of sells and minimal holdings suggest market sentiment remains to be repaired.

4. Key Variables
- @xiaomucyr…'s position changes: Large sell-offs will directly impact RFC's short-term price trends.
- New capital inflow: The entry of new Smart Traders will determine future liquidity direction.
- Monitoring of large on-chain transfers: Capital flow and trading frequency are crucial references for future trends.

5. Trend Prediction
1. Short-term slight fluctuations: Pursuit of short-term profits by holders may trigger market volatility.
2. Mid-term potential pullback pressure: If @xiaomucyr… opts to close position, significant selling pressure may lead to rapid price declines.
3. Liquidity observation: Without new large capital injections, prices may face oscillation or declines.

LUMEN structure analysis indicates that the RFC project currently exhibits characteristics dominated by short-term arbitrage and high-frequency trading strategies, with concentrated large holdings. The decision to liquidate or continue holding will directly influence short-term market volatility. Future attention should focus on the fund movements of on-chain holders and whether new liquidity infusions will maintain price stability.
