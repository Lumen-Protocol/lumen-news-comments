1. Event Identification  
Udemy (NASDAQ: UDMY) is an online learning platform currently priced at $6.61, with a forward EV/EBITDA of 10.4 times. The analyst target price is $9.53, indicating a 44.2% upside potential. However, its average revenue per user has declined by 1.6% annually, and revenue growth is expected to stagnate over the next 12 months, limiting profitability due to high marketing expenses.

2. Motivational Analysis  
Udemy's core strategy is to expand platform scale and user base by lowering monetization thresholds to attract more free or low-cost users. Management bets that future network effects will naturally increase conversion rates, sacrificing short-term user profitability for market share. Additionally, enhancing revenue stickiness through B2B course subscriptions is an attempt to combat the instability of the ToC business model.

3. Structural Perspective  
Udemy represents a typical "scale-first → monetization-later" platform structure, relying on continuous user expansion and long-term compounding on the content side. However, there is a clear breakdown in the current structure: content providers lack systematic hierarchy, user monetization paths lack automatic guidance, and high marketing costs are the only way to maintain traffic, lacking a "self-circulation" mechanism.

4. Key Variables  
• Can the platform establish a course hierarchy and structured recommendation system?  
• Can the user monetization rate recover without sacrificing scale?  
• Will the expansion of the enterprise client (Udemy Business) alleviate the weakness in the ToC business?  
• Will the market continue to accept its growth under a valuation of over 10 times EV/EBITDA in light of weakening growth?

5. Trend Prediction  
In the short term, without a new wave of B2B or AI-driven content revolution, Udemy's revenue will stagnate, and structural profitability improvements will be weak. In the medium term, if it cannot convert scale advantages into structural moats, it may hit a commercial ceiling typical of "content e-commerce" platforms.

LUMEN Structure Summary  
Udemy is a typical "traffic sedimentation-type content platform," with its business structure caught in a long-term tug-of-war between "scale contraction vs. profitability enhancement.” Without strong structural control, platform content cannot form hierarchies, and the user value curve cannot converge, resulting in reliance on external advertising and low-price strategies for user growth. This structure is deemed a dissipative expansion structure by LUMEN, lacking a self-evolving closed loop, assessed as a “pseudo-platform, weak structure, heavy-subsidy” model, showing high structural tension but weak sustainability. Long-term value remains uncertain unless structural innovation is achieved.
