2. Motivation Analysis
	1.	Short-term arbitrage and rapid exit: All major wallets completed purchases and quickly liquidated, indicating exploitation of short-term market fluctuations for profit.
	2.	Strong risk control awareness: Despite losses, solsmart88 and solsmart30 quickly liquidated to avoid further losses.
	3.	Rapid liquidity withdrawal: The high ratio of trading volume to market cap shows large funds entering and exiting quickly, without a stable market support.

⸻

3. Structural Perspective

From the LUMEN structure analysis perspective:
	•	Short-term high volatility: The project saw over 100% growth in a short time, but all major players quickly exited, reflecting strong short-term volatility characteristics.
	•	Poor fund liquidity: After the major liquidations, the market lacks liquidity, and without new funds, it may face liquidity exhaustion.
	•	High-risk market environment: Multiple Smart Traders chose to fully liquidate, indicating a high level of risk and uncertainty for the project.

⸻

4. Key Variables
	•	Potential new fund inflow: All major wallets have liquidated; whether new funds enter will determine if prices can be sustained.
	•	On-chain liquidity depth: With a market cap of only $122.29K, any significant trades will cause sharp fluctuations.
	•	Potential new Smart Trader positions: Lack of new positioning will reduce market rebound momentum.

⸻

5. Trend Prediction
	1.	High short-term retracement risk: All major wallets have liquidated, lacking new buying power, and prices may quickly fall back.
	2.	Further liquidity reduction: With major players exiting, the market is insufficiently deep, and selling pressure will be more apparent.
	3.	New fund inflow is crucial: Failure to attract new Smart Traders or funds will increase the pressure for a significant market pullback.

LUMEN Structure Analysis

The JADE project saw a significant rise in the short term, but all major funds quickly left, resulting in severe market liquidity issues. From the LUMEN structure perspective, the current rise lacks sustainability, and the inflow of new funds will be the core variable determining the short-term trend. Continued attention to large fund movements on-chain and new fund positioning is advised to prevent greater pullbacks from short-term fluctuations.
