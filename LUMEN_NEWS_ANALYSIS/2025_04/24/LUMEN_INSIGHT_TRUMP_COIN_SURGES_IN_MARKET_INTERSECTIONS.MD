# News Comment
1. Incident Identification  
Yahoo Finance reports a "Trump meme coin" surged in value by offering early buyers a dinner with Trump, igniting discussions on the intersection of political capital and the crypto market. The incident highlights the crypto market's ability to generate short-term speculation through celebrity and quasi-political access, involving crypto finance, influencer economy, and political marketing.

2. Motivational Analysis  
Motivations include: first, using "political access" to attract non-crypto users; second, leveraging this for election fundraising; and third, adjusting speculative logic with the "meme + power" narrative to create liquidity. These motivations prioritize "consensus building" over the project.

3. Structural Perspective  
The meme coin model features an "influence mapping structure": political figures serve as "liquidity nodes," embedding cryptocurrencies in power discourse and providing "political endorsement." The dinner invitation symbolizes a centralized bait in the decentralized narrative, representing a "pseudo power belief token model."

4. Key Variables  
Key outcomes depend on: Trumpâ€™s endorsement, which affects legitimacy; U.S. regulatory classification of the event; the coin's ability to create lasting narratives; and whether other political figures replicate this mechanism.

5. Trend Forecast  
Short-term, the meme coin's popularity will fluctuate based on event narratives. Medium-term, it may highlight blurred boundaries between U.S. politics and business, facing criticism for perceived corruption. Long-term, such strategies may replicate, evolving crypto assets into "emotional currency + power derivatives."

Summary of LUMEN Structure  
This event showcases a "belief-structure-price" mechanism in digital society: meme coins rise not for value but due to a "power touch illusion" that fosters belief. The LUMEN framework suggests that legitimacy stems from a "structural presence," with power serving as a price signal. Such phenomena are reshaping the boundaries of democracy and the market.
