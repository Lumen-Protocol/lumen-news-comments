# Title
LUMEN INSIGHT: DOLLAR CRISIS LOOMS ACCORDING TO DEUTSCHE

# Summary
Deutsche Bank's analysis, reported by MarketWatch on April 25, 2025, suggests significant challenges for the U.S. dollar, emphasizing structural risks stemming from high fiscal and current account deficits, de-dollarization by major global powers, and limited Federal Reserve monetary policy tools. Their perspective indicates a potential shift in global financial dynamics over the next 1-2 years, with a downward trend in the dollar index and increasing investments in alternative currencies and assets like gold and cryptocurrencies. This evolving landscape raises critical questions about the future viability of the dollar as the world's predominant currency.

1. Event Identification

On April 25, 2025, MarketWatch cited Deutsche Bank's view that the U.S. dollar is facing major trouble. This statement comes from their latest global macro outlook, suggesting that the dollar will face structural downward risks on multiple fronts, prompting a renewed focus on future currency stability.

2. Motivation Analysis

Deutsche Bank's assertion of "dollar trouble" is driven by several strategic motivations:
   • Strengthening its influence in the global currency expectations game and seizing the "macro turning point discourse";
   • Hedging against a potentially less dovish policy path from the Federal Reserve, correcting optimistic dollar assumptions early;
   • Supporting its own asset allocation strategy in non-dollar assets, gold, and European bonds, driving funds toward non-U.S. markets.

3. Structural Perspective

The "dollar crisis" is not merely a single currency event but involves a structural linkage proposition that affects the entire global financial framework. Deutsche Bank's warning is likely based on three systemic imbalances:
   • The dual deficit structure continues to worsen: the U.S. fiscal deficit and current account deficit are both at historical highs, undermining the dollar's inherent trust as a global reserve currency;
   • Accelerating de-dollarization from geopolitical finance: Non-U.S. major powers, including China and Russia, are strengthening domestic currency settlement agreements, increasing gold reserves, and establishing independent digital payment systems, thus reducing the dollar's share in global commodities and energy;
   • Constrained credit tools for the Federal Reserve: Prolonged high interest rates will limit the Fed's ability to stimulate; if the economy declines without sufficient rate buffers, the dollar's safe-haven attributes will be compromised.

4. Key Variables
   • Whether the Fed enters a "limited rate cut + continuation of QT" state of monetary weakness;
   • Further de-dollarization in emerging markets regarding settlement and reserves, such as normalization of oil settlements in RMB;
   • Continued rise of "non-sovereign value anchor" assets like gold and BTC, reflecting structural adjustments in reserve behavior;
   • Whether fiscal stimulus during the U.S. election period further expands the deficit, shaking the status of Treasuries as a safe asset.

5. Trend Forecast

If Deutsche Bank's expectations gradually become market consensus, the global financial landscape will undergo a transitional structure in the next 1-2 years:
   • The dollar index (DXY) will enter a downward trend, with funds beginning to allocate to euros, yen, and even gold and cryptocurrencies as alternative safe havens;
   • Global sovereign financial cooperation will accelerate attempts to de-dollarize pricing, especially in strategic materials trading like energy, semiconductors, and rare earths;
   • The "non-safe-havenization" of dollar assets will weaken Treasuries' role as the ultimate global liquidity pool, leading to structural re-rating in capital markets;
   • Global hedging costs for tech and energy firms will rise, leading U.S. multinational companies to utilize multi-currency liabilities and exchange rate protection mechanisms to restructure financial reporting strategies.

In summary: This is not about whether the dollar will drop, but whether the world is still willing to price the future in dollars. Deutsche Bank's judgment has formally put this question on the table.
