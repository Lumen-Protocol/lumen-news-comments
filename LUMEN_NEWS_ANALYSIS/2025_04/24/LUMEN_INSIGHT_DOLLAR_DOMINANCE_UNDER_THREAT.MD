LUMEN INSIGHT: DOLLAR DOMINANCE UNDER THREAT

# Summary
The Economist warns that the US dollar may permanently lose its status as the dominant global currency, negatively impacting developing nations reliant on it. Factors like rising de-dollarization trends, US deficits, and structural dependencies threaten economic stability in the Global South. The dollar serves as a crucial anchor for these economies but could lead to chaos if it loses prominence. Predictions indicate the dollar will maintain a safe-haven status in the short term, while alternative systems like RMB settlement may gradually emerge. Ultimately, developing countries must determine new governance models to move away from dollar dependency, initiating economic autonomy.

# News Comment
1. Event Identification  
The Economist issues a warning that the US dollar may "permanently lose its status as the global dominant currency," which could adversely affect developing countries. This assertion not only focuses on the future of the dollar system but also touches on the potential collapse of the Global South's structural dependence on the dollar.

2. Motivation Analysis  
- Imbalance in dollar hegemony: The rising trend of de-dollarization (e.g., oil settlements between China and Russia, strengthening of offshore RMB settlement mechanisms) is undermined by the US's own deficits, interest rate shocks, and political polarization, which weaken the currency's credibility.  
- Path dependence of developing countries: Long-term dollar debt binding, foreign exchange reserve allocations, and international aid mechanisms revolve around the dollar; if it loses its dominance, many fragile economies will face structural chaos due to the absence of an anchor.  
- The Economist's motivation: Acting as a "rational sentinel" of the Anglo-American financial order, it aims to issue warnings before trust in the dollar reaches a critical point, forcing the Global South to remain within the old structure.

3. Structural Perspective  
- The dollar's threefold role: reserve currency (for central banks), settlement currency (for trade), and credit currency (for sovereign debt); any instability in these areas could trigger structural collapse, yet these roles immerse developing countries in the "dollar paradox."  
- Anchor dependency structure of the Global South: Developing countries often lack stable sovereign currencies, trade credit systems, and domestic currency payment channels; the dollar serves as both their safe anchor and developmental constraint.  
- Dollar retreat vs. absence of alternative systems: The de-dollarization process is not a singular victory for one country but a restructuring of governance systems; currently, without alternatives like BRICS initiatives or a RMB system, there is no all-encompassing substitute.

4. Key Variables  
- IMF and SWIFT restructuring of the currency anchor mechanism: Without reform, the global financial order will remain in a "vacuum" between dollar inertia and reality.  
- Progress of the BRICS payment system: The feasibility of a usable cross-border settlement system will determine whether the South can escape the dollar's grip.  
- Repricing capacity of the global sovereign debt market: Whether developing countries can secure sovereign financing in "non-dollar currencies" will be a litmus test for systemic reversal.

5. Trend Predictions  
- Short-term: The dollar will maintain its safe-haven status amid political risks and geopolitical uncertainties, making it difficult for developing countries to fully detach.  
- Mid-term: A RMB settlement zone centered around China will gradually expand but will not quickly replace the dollar, resulting instead in a structure of multiple anchors.  
- Long-term: The world will enter an era of "de-anchoring," where monetary dominance is no longer concentrated in one country but rather evolves into a diverse governance mechanism supported by networks, computing power, and algorithms.

Structural Summary  
The "decline of the dollar" does not signify the end of a free order but rather the dismantling of the "global financial single-center model." When developing countries shift from dollar dependency for stability to building domestic currency credit networks, it signifies the restart of economic autonomy in a process of "decolonization." The Economist's concerns, in essence, do not advocate for developing countries but seek to stabilize the legitimacy of the dollar-centric world system. The fundamental question remains: without "King Dollar," who defines the scale of the global economy? This question will eventually need to be answered by developing countries themselves.
