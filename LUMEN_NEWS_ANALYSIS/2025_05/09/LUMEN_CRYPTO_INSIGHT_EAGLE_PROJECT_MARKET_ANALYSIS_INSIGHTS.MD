2. Motivational Analysis

From the on-chain trading behavior:
1. Clear medium-term holding intent: The three major wallets made purchases 1 day ago without any signs of selling, indicating confidence in the project's future.
2. High ROI performance: evmsmart83 and evmsmart108 have returns of +418.91% and +597.84%, indicating precise entry points.
3. Concentrated holdings: All three wallets show significant balances and no signs of reducing positions, with no arbitrage detected in the short term.

3. Structural Perspective

From the LUMEN structure analysis:
• High capital concentration: A few large holders own a significant proportion, and any reduction in positions could impact market prices.
• No apparent sell-off: Despite high ROI, these large holders have not chosen to take profits, indicating continued confidence in future performance.
• High risk and high reward coexist: Marked as High Risk, meaning capital movement may be rapid, and significant selling could cause price volatility.

4. Key Variables
• Whether evmsmart83 and evmsmart108 reduce their positions: The total holdings of both are close to $11.32K with substantial unrealized profits; profit-taking would directly affect prices.
• Monitoring on-chain capital flows: It's important to watch for new capital entering to continue pushing prices higher.
• Changes in liquidity: Under high-risk conditions, if liquidity becomes scarce, prices may drop sharply.

5. Trend Prediction
1. High short-term bullish probability: Main funds have not significantly withdrawn, and with extremely high ROI, confidence for a short-term rise is strong.
2. Large holder profit-taking may trigger a pullback: If evmsmart83 or evmsmart108 choose to take profits, prices will likely see a significant drop.
3. New capital is key: If new funds enter the market, the current upward trend will continue; otherwise, selling pressure will be difficult to bear.

LUMEN Structural Analysis

The EAGLE project currently displays characteristics of high capital concentration, with three major wallets holding most of the tokens and achieving high returns in the short term, but no selling signs are visible. Market sentiment is optimistic, but caution is advised regarding potential volatility from large holders taking profits. Close monitoring of large on-chain capital movements and changes in liquidity pools is recommended.
