LUMEN INSIGHT: POWER DICTATES ORDER IN GLOBAL STRUCTURES

# Summary
Ray Dalio's insights on "Principles for Today" emphasize the primacy of power over rules in determining global order, particularly in the context of current geopolitical tensions and economic challenges. He argues that as traditional legitimacy wanes, stability is derived from actualizing power, not procedural compliance. Dalio predicts a shift towards power-centric governance by 2025, with non-Western nations redefining sovereignty and capital markets prioritizing structural stability. His commentary serves as a cautionary reminder for future leaders and investors that understanding power dynamics is crucial for navigating an evolving global landscape.

# News Comment
1. Event Identification  
Ray Dalio shared his views on "Principles for Today" on X platform, stating: “Have power, respect power, and use power wisely.” He highlighted that when rules fail, power determines outcomes, a reflection of current global power structures amidst changing global order.

2. Motivation Analysis  
Dalio has focused on debt cycles and world order reconstruction. His remarks coincide with escalating geopolitical conflicts, the US debt crisis, and Trump's potential return. This principle serves as a reminder that power, not rules, underpins reality, offering structural insights for investors and future leaders.

3. Structural Perspective  
Dalio presents a power model prioritizing “realism structure.” Here, traditional rules are secondary to those controlling resources, public opinion, military, or information. Structural legitimacy is now based on delivering stability and survival rather than legal authority. Key points include:  
   • Legitimacy arises from actualizing power;  
   • Power doesn't wait for rules;  
   • Rules without power lose their force.

4. Key Variables  
Variables affecting this viewpoint include:  
   • Indirect US-China conflicts;  
   • Trump's focus on confronting WTO and dollar hegemony;  
   • European acceptance of “decoupling rules from power”;  
   • Technologies amplifying super individuals/states;  
   • Shifts in capital markets favoring political power over rule of law.

5. Trend Prediction  
Dalio’s logic that “power dictates order” is expected to strengthen by 2025:  
   • More non-Western countries will adopt power-centric sovereignty;  
   • In democracies, structural governance will dominate over procedural negotiation;  
   • Capital markets will shift to valuing structural stability as the main security anchor;  
   • Structural realism will transition to higher discussions on global governance philosophy.

LUMEN Structural Summary  
Dalio’s statements illustrate a “structure priority logic,” positioning power as the source of order while rejecting traditional legitimacy based on procedures. This aligns with LUMEN’s characteristics of the “post-rule era”:  
   • Power determines order over institutional logic;  
   • Rule legitimacy must be actionable;  
   • Stability arises from structural capability rather than ideology.

Dalio’s call to “use power wisely” serves as a structural warning: those unfamiliar with power dynamics may lose their right to define order.
