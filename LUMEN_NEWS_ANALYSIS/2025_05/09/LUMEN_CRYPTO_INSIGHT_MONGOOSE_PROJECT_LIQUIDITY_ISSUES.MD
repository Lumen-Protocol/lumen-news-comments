2. Motivation Analysis
	1.	Failed Short-term Arbitrage: The quick buy and subsequent liquidation of solsmart73 and solsmart30 resulted in losses, showing a misjudgment of short-term fluctuations.
	2.	Aggressive Strategy with High Returns: solsmart56, despite liquidating, achieved +178.27% ROI, indicating precise capture of selling points amid price volatility.
	3.	Poorly Liquid Market: The overall trading volume of $14K shows very limited liquidity, making short-term fluctuations more pronounced.

3. Structural Perspective

From the LUMEN structural analysis viewpoint:
	•	Fast Capital Withdrawal: Major wallets completed liquidation quickly within two days, indicating a lack of long-term holding confidence in the market.
	•	Inadequate Market Liquidity: A trading volume of $14K cannot support large buy/sell operations; more selling pressure could lead to larger declines.
	•	Single Wallet High Returns: The high returns of solsmart56 show that short-term fluctuations within the project can significantly impact with small amounts of capital.

---

4. Key Variables
	•	Secondary Market Capital Flow: The entry of new buying power will determine the project's survival capability.
	•	solsmart56’s Movements: As the only profitable wallet, whether it reinvests will signal market direction.
	•	Overall Liquidity Improvement: Current liquidity is insufficient; if trading volume does not increase in the next 24 hours, the market will remain sluggish.

5. Trend Prediction
	1.	Limited Short-term Rebound: The market currently lacks funds and major players have liquidated, limiting upward momentum.
	2.	Potential Selling Pressure Risk: If solsmart56 chooses to refill positions, it may attract more arbitrage funds; otherwise, the market will continue to weaken.
	3.	Weak Liquidity Risk: Current trading volume is far below healthy levels; new capital inflow is crucial for stabilization.

LUMEN Structural Analysis

The MONGOOSE project displays characteristics of rapid capital withdrawal and high-yield arbitrage, particularly represented by solsmart56's operations. In a situation of overall insufficient liquidity, small amounts of capital fluctuation will lead to significant price changes. The key to the project's rebound is the entry of new funds; otherwise, it will continue under selling pressure. It is advised to monitor on-chain trading trends and large transfer activities.
