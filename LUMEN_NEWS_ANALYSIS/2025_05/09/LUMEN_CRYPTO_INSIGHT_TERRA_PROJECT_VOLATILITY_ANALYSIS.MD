2. Motivation Analysis

From on-chain trading behavior:
1. Quick Testing and Exiting: solsmart7 and solsmart71 exhibited quick market testing and swift exit behaviors, both showing losses.
2. New Position Layout: solsmart53 is the only wallet still holding, showing no signs of selling, possibly waiting for further market increase.
3. Short-Term Rebound Expectation: Despite the exits by solsmart7 and solsmart71, solsmart53's continued holding indicates expectations for a short-term rebound.

3. Structural Perspective

From the perspective of LUMEN structural analysis:
• Significant Short-Term Testing Trades: Both wallets quickly exited after buying, indicating a lack of confidence in TERRA, with clear short-term arbitrage intentions.
• Concentrated and Fast In-and-Out Capital Flow: Despite high trading volume, holding intentions are weak, with capital more inclined to capture short-term fluctuations.
• Risk Preference of New Funds: The buy by solsmart53 represents a tentative entry of new funds, but current losses show ongoing market pullback pressure.

⸻
4. Key Variables
• The Direction of solsmart53's Holdings: As the only wallet holding, its selling decision will directly affect short-term market fluctuations.
• Short-term Trading Frequency: If new funds continue testing frequently, the market will likely remain in short-term volatility.
• Liquidity Stability: Although TERRA's trading volume has significantly increased, holdings are unstable and could trigger rapid sell-offs at any time.
• External Fund Inflows: If new smart traders join and hold long-term, it could change the current rapid in-and-out structure.

⸻
5. Trend Prediction
1. High Probability of Short-Term Fluctuation and Pullback: The quick exits by solsmart7 and solsmart71 indicate insufficient confidence, with potential for short-term fluctuations.
2. Continued High-Frequency Trading: Current traders are leaning towards short-term arbitrage, expecting trading frequency to remain high in the near term.
3. Difficulty Breaking Current Pressure Levels Without New Long-Term Holders: Whether solsmart53 chooses to continue holding will determine the short-term direction.

LUMEN Structural Analysis

The TERRA project currently shows clear signs of short-term volatility, with smart traders engaging in rapid in-and-out trading and low capital concentration, indicating a lack of optimism for sustained price increases. If new funds cannot consistently enter and existing holders opt to sell, short-term pullback pressure may intensify. It is advisable to monitor the on-chain dynamics of solsmart53 and changes in liquidity pools to prepare for sudden volatility.
