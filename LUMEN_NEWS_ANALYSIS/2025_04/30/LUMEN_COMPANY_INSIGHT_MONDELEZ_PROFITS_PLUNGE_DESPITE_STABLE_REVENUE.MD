1. Event Identification  
Mondelez (NASDAQ: MDLZ) released its Q1 2025 financial report, showing flat overall revenue but a significant drop in profit margins, highlighting the severe erosion of profitability due to cost pressures. Key figures include revenue of $9.31 billion, in line with market expectations; adjusted EPS of $0.74, exceeding expectations by 12.2%; however, adjusted EBITDA was only $1 billion, far below the market expectation of $1.54 billion, missing by 34.7%. Operating profit margin plummeted from 29.4% to 7.3%, and free cash flow profit margin fell to 8.8%. Organic revenue grew by 3.1% year-on-year, but sales decreased by 3.5%. The current market capitalization of the company is approximately $84.3 billion.  

2. Motivational Analysis  
Faced with high raw material costs (especially cocoa) and weak consumer demand, the company attempted to stabilize revenue by raising product prices, which has led to a continued decline in sales. Its short-term motivation is to ensure revenue stability and maintain accountability to the capital market; long-term, the goal is to leverage brand influence to enhance unit value, but effective profit recovery has yet to be achieved.  

3. Structural Perspective  
Mondelez exhibits a typical structural contradiction of "price increases to maintain revenue, with profits being squeezed." While revenue remains stable, the substantial drop in EBITDA indicates that the price increase strategy has not fully covered cost impacts, especially amid high inflation for raw materials and transportation. The mass-market product categories within its portfolio are highly price-sensitive, resulting in a dual loss regarding price and sales; structural leverage effects are failing, leading to a comprehensive contraction in profit margins.  

4. Key Variables  
- Price fluctuations in cocoa and sugar raw materials will directly affect future profit elasticity;  
- Consumer tolerance for continued price increases will determine whether organic growth can be sustained;  
- The brand's ability to fend off substitutes;  
- The speed of cost structure optimization and supply chain coordination improvements.  

5. Trend Forecast  
If raw material prices remain high and the company continues to stabilize revenue through price increases, the decline in sales will worsen, further deteriorating profitability. In the medium term, Mondelez may have to rely on layoffs, SKU streamlining, and operational expense cuts to restore EBITDA elasticity. Until structural imbalances are resolved, valuation will depend more on cash flow stability rather than growth potential.

LUMEN Structural Summary:  
Mondelez is in a phase of structural compression: rising rigidity on the cost side and approaching the limits of price increases on the revenue side create an anti-structural tension of "stable income—profit loss." Its business model is shifting from "strong brand driving profitability" to "strong brand delaying decline," with valuation being re-priced around low growth, high brand strength, but weak profit elasticity logic.
