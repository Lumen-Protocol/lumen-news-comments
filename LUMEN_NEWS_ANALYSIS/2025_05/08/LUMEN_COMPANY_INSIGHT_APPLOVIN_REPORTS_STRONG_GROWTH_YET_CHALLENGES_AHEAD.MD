2. Motivation Analysis

AppLovin's performance shows strong growth from both mobile gaming and advertising. The 40.3% revenue increase is driven by advertising expansion and mobile game penetration. Adjusted EBITDA reflects efficient cost control. However, weaker advertising guidance suggests potential growth challenges.

3. Structural Perspective

AppLovin's core revenue sources are advertising and mobile gaming. High gross margins in advertising contributed to EBITDA growth, while operating margin improvement indicates better revenue efficiency. The advertising revenue guidance signals market competition and a potential downturn.

   • Game monetization and acquisition costs: Influence long-term profit margins.
   • Competition: Impacts market share against Unity and IronSource.
   • Advertising technology innovation: Key for revenue enhancement.

5. Trend Forecast

If AppLovin optimizes its advertising algorithms, stable revenue growth is expected. However, advertising market softness may pressure future guidance. Reducing user acquisition costs and extending game lifecycles are important. Focusing on ad platform precision and exploring international markets are crucial for broadening the user base.
