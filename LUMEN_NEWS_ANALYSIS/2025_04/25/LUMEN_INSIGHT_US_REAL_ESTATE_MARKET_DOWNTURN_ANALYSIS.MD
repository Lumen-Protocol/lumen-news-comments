LUMEN INSIGHT: US REAL ESTATE MARKET DOWNTURN ANALYSIS

# Summary
On April 25, 2025, MarketWatch highlighted a significant month-over-month decline in U.S. real estate transactions, notably existing-home sales, marking a structural freeze in market activity. This decline results from high-interest rates, leading to suppressed buyer financing willingness and the "lock-in effect" discouraging homeowners from selling. A mismatch between buyer and seller expectations exacerbates the issue. The decline signifies a dual structural collapse driven by long-term supply-demand imbalances and short-term credit contraction. The outlook for the market hints at a slow cycle of deleveraging and price revaluation, reshaping financial perceptions and investment models in real estate.

1. Event Identification

On April 25, 2025, MarketWatch reported that the U.S. real estate market is experiencing its most severe month-over-month decline in transactions since 2022, particularly in existing-home sales, indicating a structural freeze in market activity.

2. Motivation Analysis

The significant drop in transaction volume is not triggered by isolated events but results from the interplay of macro policies, consumer confidence, and market mechanics, specifically:
   • Persistent high-interest rates suppress financing willingness, raising the entry threshold for potential buyers, with mortgage burdens far exceeding pre-pandemic levels;
   • The "lock-in effect" on interest rates prevents supply, as many homeowners are unwilling to sell and switch properties due to enjoying long-term fixed rates around 3%;
   • Misaligned expectations between buyers and sellers, with sellers clinging to price anchors from the pandemic period, while buyers view the market as on the brink of a potential bubble burst.

3. Structural Perspective

This sharp decline in sales reflects a dual structural collapse in the U.S. real estate market due to "long-term supply-demand mismatch + short-term credit contraction," revealing the following deep-seated structural imbalances:
   • Price rigidity vs. financing liquidity: While housing prices have not significantly declined nominally, actual purchasing power is eroded by inflation and interest rates, creating a deadlock of "prices not falling, transactions stagnant";
   • Credit system stagnating asset circulation: High rates hinder middle-class liquidity, interrupting the existing "chain transaction mechanism" in the housing market;
   • Structural inventory differentiation: High-end properties retain a financial asset substitute characteristic, while mid-to-low-end housing faces a double bind of being "unaffordable and unsellable";
   • With the real estate market losing its "asset appreciation fantasy," it becomes a pure liability anchor, detaching transactions from psychological returns.

4. Key Variables
   • Whether the Federal Reserve will signal clear easing before mid-year to alleviate market interest rate pressures;
   • Whether mortgage products will restart the "variable-rate + partial government guarantee" mechanism to ease first-time buying barriers;
   • Whether unemployment and consumer confidence will deteriorate simultaneously, accelerating the market into an "irrational sell-off period";
   • Whether urban population flows (migration in/out) will further concentrate, making certain regional properties "illiquid dead assets."

5. Trend Forecast

If existing-home sales continue to decline, it will mark the entry of the U.S. housing market into a **"deleveraging + price revaluation" slow cycle**, potentially driving the following trends:
   • Real estate will no longer have systematic rise expectations, leading financial institutions to re-price property-related loan assets;
   • PropTech and brokerage platforms will spark innovations in "liquidity solutions," such as selling before buying, guarantee bridging, and dual contract mechanisms;
   • Regional real estate crises may spread to local finances, with states like California and Illinois, dependent on property taxes, facing budget cuts;
   • The perception of long-term residence and wealth models will reshape: More young families will opt for renting and investment portfolios instead of the traditional wealth path anchored in property.

Conclusion: The plunge in existing-home sales is not just "data deterioration," but a systemic signal: an era reliant on real estate as a confidence anchor is quietly ending.
