# News Comment
1. Event Identification  
Bloomberg’s “Big Take” podcast discusses the IMF and Bloomberg Economics' predictions on the potential global economic effects of a new trade war led by the Trump administration, indicating that trade policy is a key factor in U.S. macroeconomic expectations, affecting GDP, employment, supply chains, and geopolitics.

2. Motivation Analysis  
- Trump Administration's Motivations: Solidifying the “America First” label for blue-collar voters, using trade barriers for negotiations, and undermining foreign competitors to reshape global supply structures.  
- IMF and Bloomberg’s Motivations: The IMF warns of “trade barriers-inflation-capital flight” risks, while Bloomberg analyzes market dynamics for investor risk assessment.  
- Market Participants' Motivations: Investors focus on which sectors (e.g., chips, autos) will face new tariffs, adjusting portfolios for risk.

3. Structural Perspective  
- International Trade Structure: The Trump-style trade war aims to disrupt liberal frameworks by creating a closed-loop supply structure centered on “de-China-ization.”  
- Global Capital Flow Structure: Trade wars boost dollar assets' safe-haven status but may increase de-dollarization among emerging markets, leading to capital volatility.  
- Domestic Economic Structure: Tariffs will raise consumer goods prices, affecting middle-class disposable income and prompting the Fed to rethink inflation dynamics.  
- Political Legitimacy Structure: The trade war offers a means for the government to gain legitimacy, shifting the narrative from “manufacturing foreign enemies” to “governance efficiency.” 

4. Key Variables  
- Affected Products and Countries: Targeting high-tech or low-end goods will influence CPI and employment outcomes.  
- Chinese Countermeasures: Concurrent sanctions from China could escalate the trade war.  
- Federal Reserve Policy: Heightened inflation expectations from tariffs could lead to dilemmas over growth and price shocks, delaying rate cuts.  
- 2025 Budget Legislation: Fiscal expansion combined with trade conflict introduces uncertainties in national debt markets.  
- US-EU Manufacturing Firms: Genuine supply chain relocations versus mere tax origin shifts will affect policy outcomes.

5. Trend Predictions  
- Short-Term: Market volatility increases, dollar strengthens, gold demand rises, with disparities in manufacturing and retail.  
- Medium-Term: Continued trade restrictions by Trump may lower global growth by 0.4%-0.6%, affecting U.S. import costs and consumer purchasing power.  
- Long-Term: Global systems will shift from “American-style globalization” to “regional supply chains,” with pressures on Global South countries in currency and geopolitics.

Structural Summary:  
The trade war transforms governance legitimacy, macro expectations, and monetary systems. The Trump administration redefines national credit boundaries with tariffs, suggesting that tariffs, rather than the dollar, shape global economic control. The IMF and Bloomberg acknowledge that the monetary system is a derivative of geopolitical governance, signaling a transition from the Bretton Woods to a “Bretton trench system” with dividing tariffs, marking the trade war as a test of global governance logic.
