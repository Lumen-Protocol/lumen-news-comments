# Title
LUMEN INSIGHT: TRADE TALKS STALLED BETWEEN CHINA US

# Summary
Shehzad Qazi, an international board member of China's Beige Book, asserts that direct negotiations between Trump and Xi are unlikely, with the U.S. maintaining a hardline stance on tariffs. The Chinese leadership seeks to preserve authority without appearing to concede to the U.S., while the Trump administration employs tariffs to leverage negotiations and signals potential de-escalation to stabilize markets. The dynamics reflect a psychological game of concessions, with both parties engaging in indirect communications. Predictive analyses indicate ongoing lower-level discussions focused on peripheral issues, amidst pressures from domestic and international contexts, suggesting a strategic contest rooted in broader political ideologies.

# News Comment
1. Incident Recognition  
Shehzad Qazi, an international board member of China's Beige Book, stated that Trump and Xi will not engage in direct negotiations, noting, “This is not something Xi is willing to do.” Meanwhile, U.S. Treasury Secretary Bessent clearly indicated that there are no plans to cut tariffs on China, emphasizing that both parties must achieve “de-escalation” and “mutual easing,” reflecting a structural hardline stance from the U.S. alongside a pragmatic compromise in its China policy.

2. Motivation Analysis  
- From the Chinese side: To maintain domestic stability and the authority of leadership, avoiding any visual appearance of “conceding to Trump” and reinforcing a “mutual, systematic” approach to foreign affairs.  
- The Trump administration: On one hand, trying to use high tariffs to pressure negotiations; on the other, sending vague signals of possible “de-escalation” to attract markets and stabilize stock indices.  
- Treasury stance: Conveying signals of “policy rationality,” providing manageable buffers in dealing with domestic politics and international markets.  
- Market analysis institutions: Using insights into leaders' psychology to offer predictive logic for trades to financial institutions, facilitating hedging strategies.

3. Structural Perspective (LLL)  
- Logic layer: This is not a diplomatic disagreement about “whether to negotiate,” but a psychological game about “who concedes first.” Direct contact symbolizes systemic yielding, so both sides will continue to navigate through proxies, secondary channels, and industrial means.  
- Language layer: Keywords such as “de-escalation,” “no plans to cut tariffs,” and “not something Xi would do” reflect typical structured denial language, not closing pathways but setting prerequisites.  
- Connection layer: Through a model of “mutual buffer setting—public opinion reflection—strategic transition,” a low-intensity but highly complex structural game zone has been constructed among the Treasury, financial media, market experts, and the Chinese diplomatic system.

4. Key Variables  
- Whether China releases conditions for tariff easing on a non-public basis.  
- Whether Trump proactively opens a negotiation window due to election pressures or internal party dynamics.  
- Whether U.S. stocks experience significant fluctuations due to tariff deadlock, forcing concessions from the U.S. side.  
- Whether there are internal discrepancies in policy coordination among the Treasury, White House staff, and the State Department.

5. Trend Prediction  
In the coming weeks, there will be no direct high-level negotiations between China and the U.S., but lower-level, multi-track contacts will gradually unfold, achieving symbolic compromises on peripheral topics such as “technology tariffs,” “energy relaxations,” and “agricultural procurements,” providing structural stops for the election and market. Meanwhile, “who concedes” will continue to be an ideological test for both sides’ domestic politics.

Structural Summary:  
This “non-starting” negotiation is essentially a strategic contest over time, face, and structural sequences. Xi's decision not to talk is not due to an aversion to negotiation, but a refusal to operate on “Trump's timetable”; Trump’s decision not to cut tariffs isn’t absolute resistance but a desire to first reap the diplomatic benefits of “forced concessions.” Amid the pressures of markets and policies, “talks” are ongoing, but recognizing “the need to talk” first will be the key to this round of Sino-U.S. logical games.
