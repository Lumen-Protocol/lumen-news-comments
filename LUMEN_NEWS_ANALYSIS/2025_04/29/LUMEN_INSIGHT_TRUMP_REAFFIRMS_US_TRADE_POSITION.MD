LUMEN INSIGHT: TRUMP REAFFIRMS US TRADE POSITION

# Summary
1. Event Identification  
President Trump publicly stated in the Oval Office: "Our trade relationship with China is very good, and our relationships with almost all countries are very good. Everyone wants to engage with the United States—ultimately, we have what they want." This statement appears to express confidence in the current state of global trade; however, in the context of the ongoing adjustment in the Sino-U.S. trade war, the restructuring of U.S. exports to India, and the stratification of the China-Middle East-ASEAN supply chain, the meaning of this statement goes beyond mere "diplomatic reassurance."  

2. Motivation Analysis  
The core motivation behind Trump's statement is not to appease China, but to reaffirm America's structural advantages in global technology, finance, and the dollar settlement system through "we have what they want," thereby stabilizing the psychological positioning of multiple countries during renegotiations with the U.S. This is a typical LUMEN linguistic action: reframing the narrative of "exchange power structures" in the global cognitive game.
