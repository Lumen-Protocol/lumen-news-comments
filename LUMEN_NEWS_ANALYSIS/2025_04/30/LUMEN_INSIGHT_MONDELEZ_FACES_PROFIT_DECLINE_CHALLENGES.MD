1. Event Identification  
Mondelez (NASDAQ: MDLZ) released its Q1 2025 financial report, showing flat overall revenue but a significant decline in profit margins, highlighting the severe erosion of profitability due to cost pressures. Key figures: revenue was $9.31 billion, in line with market expectations; adjusted EPS was $0.74, exceeding expectations by 12.2%; however, adjusted EBITDA was only $1 billion, far below the market expectation of $1.54 billion, missing by 34.7%. Operating profit margin plummeted from 29.4% to 7.3%, and free cash flow margin dropped to 8.8%. Organic revenue grew by 3.1% year-on-year, but sales volume fell by 3.5%. The current market capitalization of the company is approximately $84.3 billion.

2. Motivation Analysis  
Faced with high raw material costs (especially cocoa) and weak consumer demand, the company has raised product prices to stabilize revenue, but this has led to continued declines in sales volume. Its short-term motivation is to prevent revenue collapse and maintain accountability to the capital markets; long-term, it aims to leverage brand influence to enhance unit value but has not yet effectively translated this into a recovery of profits.

3. Structural Insight  
Mondelez exhibits a typical structural contradiction of "raising prices to maintain revenue while profit is squeezed." Although revenue remains stable, the sharp decline in EBITDA indicates that the pricing strategy has not fully covered the impact of costs, particularly raw material and transportation expenses amid high inflation. The mass-market categories in its product mix are highly price-sensitive, resulting in a mutually damaging price-volume situation; structural leverage effects have failed, leading to a contraction in profit margins.

4. Key Variables  
• Price fluctuations in cocoa and sugar will directly affect future profit elasticity;  
• Consumer tolerance for continued price increases will determine if organic growth can be sustained;  
• The brand's ability to fend off direct substitutes;  
• The pace of cost structure optimization and improvements in supply chain synergy.

5. Trend Forecast  
If raw material prices remain high and the company continues to stabilize income through price increases, sales declines will exacerbate, leading to further deterioration in profitability. In the medium term, Mondelez may need to rely on layoffs, SKU rationalization, and trimming operating expenses to restore EBITDA elasticity. Until the structural imbalance is resolved, valuation will increasingly depend on cash flow stability rather than growth potential.

LUMEN Structural Summary:  
Mondelez is currently in a phase of structural compression: rising rigidity on the cost side while income has reached the limits of price increases, creating a counter-structural tension of "stable income—profit loss." Its business model is transitioning from "strong brands driving profits" to "strong brands delaying decline," and valuation will be repositioned around low growth, high brand power but weak profit elasticity.
