# News Comment
🧠 1. Event Recognition  
CNBC cites Evercore ISI chief analyst Krishna Guha warning that if President Trump tries to dismiss Federal Reserve Chair Powell, it could trigger a “severe market reaction.” The market is currently closely watching whether the tension between Trump and the Fed will escalate into a systemic conflict.

🔍 2. Motivational Analysis  
Trump has long criticized high-interest-rate policies, believing they hinder economic recovery. With his second term now underway, reshaping monetary policy and targeting an “independent but unaccountable” central bank may become part of his structural agenda.

🧩 3. Structural Perspective  
This is an extension of the long-standing conflict between “monetary sovereignty vs. technical independence.” Powell represents the institutional inertia of the Fed and global central bank consensus, while Trump embodies a populist assertion that “electoral mandate trumps technical neutrality.” The structural contradictions between the two are nearly irreconcilable.

🧮 4. Key Variables  
• Existence of legal pathways to bypass Fed independence safeguards  
• Market repricing of the Fed's credibility  
• Whether inflation and employment data support Trump’s push for “interest rate reform”  
• Level of internal Republican support for dismissing Powell  

📈 5. Trend Forecast  
If an attempt to dismiss Powell materializes, it will lead to a market repricing of monetary policy coherence, with bond yields rising in the short term, enhanced dollar volatility, and potential initial declines followed by rebounds in tech stocks. In the medium term, the Fed's mechanisms may fall under stronger political control, leading to a reassessment of inflation expectations.  

🧭 Structural Summary  
This is not just a personnel storm but a direct challenge to the “technical governance system” by the Trump administration in its second term. The market's concern is not about Powell personally, but whether “monetary policy will become the next battleground in the White House economic war.” This question cannot be avoided.
