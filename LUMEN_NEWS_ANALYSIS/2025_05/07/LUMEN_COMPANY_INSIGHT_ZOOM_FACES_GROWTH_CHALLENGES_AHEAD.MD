2. Motivation Analysis

The slowdown in Zoom's growth primarily stems from reduced demand for remote work, coupled with increased competition pressing on its market share. To maintain its position, Zoom plans to enhance its infrastructure and expand its product line through increased capital expenditure. However, the slow growth in ARR indicates insufficient stickiness in its core subscription business, with enterprise customer renewal rates falling below expectations, reflecting declining market confidence in its long-term value.

3. Structural Perspective

From a LUMEN structural perspective, Zoom’s business model encounters the following structural issues:
   1. Slowing Growth and Market Saturation
After rapid expansion during the pandemic, Zoom’s growth has significantly slowed, as enterprise clients shift towards diverse video conferencing solutions, weakening its market dominance.
   2. Intensifying Competition and Price Pressure
Major tech companies like Microsoft Teams and Google Meet are continually expanding their market share, creating pricing pressures that make it difficult for Zoom to maintain high profit margins.
   3. Capital Expenditure and Cash Flow Risk
Zoom plans to invest to withstand competition, but the decline in free cash flow indicates increasing investment pressure in the short term. If these investments do not generate revenue growth, it could lead to financial strain.

   2. Recovery of Remote Work Demand in the Market
   3. Product Iteration and Market Penetration by Competitors

5. Trend Forecast

Based on LUMEN's rational analysis framework, Zoom's future growth will increasingly depend on the speed of its commercialization transformation and product diversification. If it can enhance stickiness among large enterprise clients and improve the integration of its video conferencing solutions, there remains an opportunity for growth recovery. However, in the short term, declining free cash flow and intense market competition will continue to exert pressure, potentially leading to stock price volatility.

LUMEN Structural Analysis

Zoom's market performance reveals growth challenges after initial rapid expansion. From a LUMEN perspective, its greatest challenges lie in structural market saturation and intensified competition. Whether its increased capital expenditure can lead to actual growth will be crucial for its future. Zoom needs to adopt a more strategic approach to product diversification and deepen engagement with enterprise customers to prevent further market erosion.
