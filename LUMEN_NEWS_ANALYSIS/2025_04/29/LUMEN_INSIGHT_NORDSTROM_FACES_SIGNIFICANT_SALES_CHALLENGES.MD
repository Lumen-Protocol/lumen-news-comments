1. Event Recognition  
Nordstrom (NYSE: JWN) is a high-end department store chain known for its premium customer service, with a market value of approximately $4.03 billion. It is currently facing declining same-store sales, weak profitability, and low capital returns.  

2. Motivation Analysis  
Nordstrom aims to attract new customers and maintain the loyalty of existing ones by upholding high customer experience standards, optimizing its product mix, and adjusting its operational model, while struggling to stabilize sales and profits against a backdrop of consumer downgrading and intensified online competition.  

3. Structural Perspective  
Nordstrom's business structure exhibits the following characteristics:  
- The main business relies on high-end offline department store channels, limited by store coverage and changes in consumer spending capacity.  
- Same-store sales have declined for two consecutive years, indicating a decreasing attractiveness of the traditional department store model in the current economic environment.  
- Low operating profit margins restrict the companyâ€™s flexibility to respond to market changes and hinder quick strategic adjustments.  
- Low capital returns demonstrate inefficiencies in management's capital allocation and investment return generation.  
- Although the Forward P/E is only 11.6x, suggesting low valuation, low growth and structural disadvantages have been significantly reflected in market expectations.  

4. Key Variables  
- Consumer confidence and high-end consumption trends: If the macro economy continues to weaken, the demand risk for high-end department stores will rise.  
- Store efficiency: The ability of same-store sales to turn positive will directly impact cash flow quality and the sustainability of expansion plans.  
- Progress in online transformation: Whether the online channel can offset the decline in offline traffic is crucial for long-term survival.  
- Capital expenditure management: Failure to effectively control spending or improve investment returns will increase cash flow pressure.  

5. Trend Prediction  
In the next 12-24 months, Nordstrom may continue to face pressure on offline sales and constrained profitability. If it fails to quickly improve capital returns and enhance operational flexibility, even with cheap valuations, it will be difficult to prompt market re-rating, posing risks of stagnant or slowly declining stock prices. If the macro environment worsens, there may be further adjustments to earnings expectations.  

LUMEN Structural Summary  
As a traditional high-end department store, Nordstrom is experiencing systematic weakening due to the dual impact of changing consumer structure and declining operational efficiency. Current low valuations do not conceal fundamental issues such as weak growth, inadequate capital returns, and limited strategic flexibility. Against a challenging macro environment, these structural disadvantages will likely be magnified by the market, continuously suppressing the company's valuation system.
