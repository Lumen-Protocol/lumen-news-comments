2. Motivation Analysis

From on-chain trading behavior:
1. Quick exit with deep losses: solsmart50, solsmart73, and solsmart74 completed liquidation shortly with significant losses, showing a high escape willingness.
2. Failure of high-frequency speculation: solsmart73 had 9 buys in 24 hours, quickly liquidated with an 87.22% loss, indicating a failure of short-term strategies.
3. Extreme panic selling: A decline of -96.28% triggered widespread liquidation, showing a clear disruption in the capital chain.

3. Structural Perspective

From a LUMEN structural analysis viewpoint:
• Trading strategies failed: High-frequency operations did not yield positive returns, instead causing significant losses and a breakdown in capital liquidity.
• Insufficient market depth: With a market value of only $28.72K, even slight selling pressure can cause extreme price drops.
• Very high liquidity risk: The wave of liquidation leads to greater liquidity exhaustion, making it difficult for the project to attract new funds.

⸻
4. Key Variables
• Liquidity recovery: The entry of new Smart Traders for bottom-fishing will determine if the market can rebound.
• Monitoring of large on-chain transfers: Continued outflow of funds would make it hard for POPE to escape the liquidity trap.
• Market sentiment recovery: The -96.28% drop is devastating to market sentiment; its recovery will dictate future trends.

⸻
5. Trend Forecast
1. Continued downward pressure in the short term: Failure of high-frequency trading has led to swift capital flight, with insufficient market liquidity for recovery soon.
2. Significant liquidity risk: Without new capital inflows, the POPE project may continue to decline or even reach zero.
3. Continued wave of selling: The extreme losses experienced by participants may trigger deeper sell-offs, leading to greater price volatility.

LUMEN Structural Analysis

The POPE project is currently in a state of extremely weak liquidity, with high-frequency trading strategies resulting in significant losses and rapid capital withdrawal. Market depth is insufficient, leading to a liquidity gap and high risk of going to zero. Future price trends heavily depend on new liquidity infusion; otherwise, the project will face immense pressure to decline further. Close attention is advised for on-chain capital flow and potential large transaction changes.
