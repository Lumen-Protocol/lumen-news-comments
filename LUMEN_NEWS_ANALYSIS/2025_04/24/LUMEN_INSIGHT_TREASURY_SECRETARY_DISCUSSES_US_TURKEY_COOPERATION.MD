LUMEN INSIGHT: TREASURY SECRETARY DISCUSSES US TURKEY COOPERATION

# Summary
On April 25, 2025, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced enhanced economic cooperation with Turkey, indicating a strategic shift in U.S. Middle Eastern policy under the Trump administration. The discussions with Turkish Finance Minister Mehmet Şimşek aim to solidify U.S. influence in the region while continuing the "maximum pressure" campaign against Iran. This strategy employs economic diplomacy, redefined as "financial armed diplomacy," to reinforce alliances and signal a possible realignment among Middle Eastern nations. The statement raises questions on Turkey's stances and the potential for a broader geopolitical impact on U.S.-China-Russia dynamics and Iran's reactions.

# News Comment
1. Event Identification

On April 25, 2025, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent issued a statement on the X platform, announcing that he had engaged in "broad and in-depth discussions" with Turkish Finance Minister Mehmet Şimşek regarding U.S.-Turkey economic cooperation, enhanced coordination in the Middle East, and collaboration in the context of Ukraine and Russia issues. He also emphasized that the Trump administration remains committed to the "maximum pressure" policy against Iran.

2. Motivation Analysis

This statement clearly indicates more than general economic cooperation discussions and carries three strategic intentions:
	•	Reinforcing the Middle Eastern restructuring: By enhancing economic and strategic collaboration with Turkey, the U.S. aims to indirectly strengthen its involvement in Middle Eastern matters, aligning with President Trump's priorities in the region.
	•	Continuation of the "multilateral leverage replacing military force" model: The Treasury Secretary addressing strategic topics indicates that during the Biden era, "soft power diplomacy" has been redefined by the Trump administration into "financial armed diplomacy," using economic ties to build influence.
	•	Signaling a restart of the anti-Iran coalition: The emphasis on "maximum pressure" against Iran aims to reactivate the regional anti-Iran structure, while seeking Turkey's balancing role outside the U.S.-Israel-Saudi axis.

3. Structural Perspective

The structure of the statement follows the "economic entry—geopolitical expansion—targeting the enemy" model:
	•	Economic cooperation as the starting point: Using "increase economic engagement" as a low-resistance entry to communication, avoiding triggering domestic concerns in Turkey;
	•	Embedding the Middle East agenda: The phrase "further POTUS’ priorities in the Middle East" binds economic cooperation with geopolitical objectives, creating a structural agenda integration;
	•	Strengthening the enemy structure: The phrase "maximum pressure campaign against Iran" serves as a final anchor statement, reaffirming the core adversary and establishing a clear boundary between friend and foe.

4. Key Variables
	•	Whether Turkey will publicly acknowledge a shift in its stance on Iran or continue to maintain a vague balance of "economic cooperation but diplomatic independence";
	•	Whether other Middle Eastern countries (like Saudi Arabia, UAE, Israel) will interpret this statement as a signal for a new strategic alignment and respond accordingly;
	•	Whether Iran will respond to the U.S.-Turkey coordination through proxy networks or energy markets, potentially triggering a regional chain reaction;
	•	Whether the U.S. will systematize fiscal policy (sanctions, funding channels, export restrictions) into a new generation of "structural tactics."

5. Trend Forecast

Such rhetoric signals that the Trump administration is incorporating the Treasury into the core axis of geopolitical strategy advancement, with diplomacy no longer solely led by the State Department but rather exerting control through an integrated structure of "finance-energy-security." If Turkey accepts this structure, it could become a "tactical pivot" in the conflict of the U.S.-China-Russia triangular order. For Iran, this "demilitarized yet structurally enclosing" approach may prove more destructive and lasting than conventional sanctions.
