LUMEN INSIGHT: SIDES TAKING IN US CHINA RIVALRY

# Summary
The US-China trade war has progressed into a "sides-taking" phase under President Trump, compelling smaller nations to align with either power, thus diminishing their strategic autonomy. The US aims to bolster economic nationalism and gauge ally loyalty, while China seeks to enhance influence through the "Global South" initiative and infrastructure investments. This evolving geopolitical landscape reflects a redistribution of global power dynamics, with neutral nations facing pressure to decide and emphasize supply chain sovereignty. Over the next 18 months, unless disrupted, emerging nations may adopt a passive stance amidst growing de-globalization, fundamentally reshaping international economic alignments and structures.

# News Comment
1. **Event Identification**  
According to Foreign Policy, with President Trump regaining power, the US-China trade war has entered a "sides-taking" phase. Both countries are pressuring third countries to choose sides, shrinking the strategic space for small and medium countries and shifting great power rivalry to reconfiguring alliances.

2. **Motivation Analysis**  
• **US Motivation:** The Trump administration seeks to strengthen economic nationalism, prevent capital from flowing to China, and gauge ally loyalty.  
• **China's Motivation:** China aims to attract developing countries through the "Global South" initiative, evade Western financial pressures, and bolster its geopolitical buffer via infrastructure and low-interest loans.

3. **Structural Perspective**  
The current sides-taking phase, while framed as trade disputes, fundamentally redistributes global structural weight. The G7-led order faces challenges from multipolarity, especially in technology and finance, leading to a collapsing "non-aligned zone." Countries now face path dependence shaped by structural logic, with choices impacting their economic alignments.

4. **Key Variables**  
• **Shrinkage of neutral countries:** Many nations are pressured to take sides, with countries like India, Brazil, and Indonesia becoming leverage points.  
• **Supply chain sovereignty:** Countries emphasize control over critical resources, leading to regionally closed economies.  
• **Treaty-based hegemony:** Initiatives like China’s Belt and Road and US alliances reflect a rivalry through treaty-based structural control.  
• **Bipolar financial settlements:** A redefinition of the international credit system is underway, with trends towards Asian currency pools and de-dollarization affecting US financial dominance.

5. **Trend Prediction**  
In the next 18 months, unless an unexpected event occurs, global "sides-taking" will normalize. Emerging countries will likely adopt a "wait-and-see" stance while the US and China exert pressure through trade and military support. De-globalization and structuralism will dominate the geopolitical landscape post-2025.

**LUMEN Structural Summary**  
This event indicates a shift towards a structural world, with countries losing autonomy. "Taking sides" reflects structural logic, where "structure precedes stance." The future competition will hinge on the defining structures, not merely sides in the global arena.
