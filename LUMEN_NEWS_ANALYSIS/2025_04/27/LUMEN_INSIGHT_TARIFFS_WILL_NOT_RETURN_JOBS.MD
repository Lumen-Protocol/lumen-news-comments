2. Motivation Analysis  
• Media Motivation: The media aims to undermine the Trump administration's narrative linking tariffs to job returns by quoting financial sector figures.  
• Ken Griffin's Motivation: Griffin favors free trade, opposing tariffs to maintain capital mobility and low-cost supply chains.  
• Trump Administration's Motivation: The administration uses tariffs to pressure the manufacturing supply chain for political mobilization, especially in the Midwest.

3. Structural Perspective  
• Structural Barriers: Returning manufacturing faces barriers such as infrastructure, labor costs, and environmental regulations that tariffs can't easily reverse.  
• Division Between Financial and Industrial Capital: Wall Street seeks returns from globalization, while local manufacturing prioritizes employment, revealing a misalignment of interests.  
• Conflict Between Electoral Politics and Economic Logic: Tariff narratives may aid elections but can lead to long-term economic inefficiency and higher consumer costs if they don't support job recovery.

4. Key Variables  
• U.S. domestic manufacturing investment incentives;  
• The return proportion of high-end vs. traditional manufacturing;  
• The impact of tariff increases on consumer goods prices;  
• U.S. labor market's capacity to support manufacturing expansion;  
• The preference of financial capital for domestic investments versus overseas operations.

5. Trend Forecast  
• Short-term tariff effects on manufacturing may be limited, focusing on high-tech industries;  
• Traditional manufacturing jobs are unlikely to see a large-scale revival;  
• Wall Street may resist excessive protectionism, favoring supply chain diversification;  
• A cycle of “strengthened tariffs in election years” may emerge, influenced by political and economic factors;  
• The focus of manufacturing transformation will shift to high-end smart manufacturing rather than labor-intensive repatriation.

LUMEN Structure Summary  
This event highlights tensions in U.S. politics:  
• Populist politics versus rational globalization;  
• Structural challenges in manufacturing revival;  
• Misalignment between financial and industrial interests;  
• Disconnection between short-term narratives and long-term outcomes.

The narrative of “tariffs = manufacturing return” is complex, intertwined with global capital networks and labor transformations. True reconstruction requires systematic restructuring beyond tariffs.
