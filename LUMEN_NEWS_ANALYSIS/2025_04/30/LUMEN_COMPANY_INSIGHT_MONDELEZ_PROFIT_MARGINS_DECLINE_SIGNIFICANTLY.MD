1. Event identification  
Mondelez (NASDAQ: MDLZ) released its Q1 2025 financial report, showing flat overall revenue but a significant decline in profit margins, highlighting severe erosion of profitability due to cost pressures. Key figures include: revenue of $9.31 billion, in line with market expectations; adjusted EPS of $0.74, exceeding expectations by 12.2%; however, adjusted EBITDA was only $1 billion, far below the market expectation of $1.54 billion, missing by 34.7%. Operating profit margin plummeted from 29.4% to 7.3%, and free cash flow margin decreased to 8.8%. Organic revenue grew 3.1% year-on-year, but sales volume fell 3.5%. The company's current market capitalization is approximately $84.3 billion.  

2. Motivation analysis  
In light of high raw material costs (especially cocoa) and weak consumer demand, the company has raised product prices to stabilize revenue, but this has led to continued sales decline. Its short-term motivation is to ensure revenue stability and maintain credibility with capital markets; long-term, it aims to leverage brand influence to increase unit value, though this has not yet effectively translated into profit recovery.  

3. Structural perspective  
Mondelez exhibits a classic structural contradiction of "raising prices to maintain revenue while profits are squeezed." Although revenue remains stable, the significant decline in EBITDA shows that the pricing strategy has failed to fully mitigate cost impacts, especially with high inflation affecting raw materials and transport costs. Mainstream product categories within the portfolio are highly sensitive to price changes, creating a situation where both price and volume suffer; structural leverage effects are failing, leading to a contraction in profit margins.  

4. Key variables  
- Fluctuations in cocoa and sugar prices will directly affect future profit elasticity.  
- Consumer tolerance for ongoing price increases will determine the sustainability of organic growth.  
- The brand’s ability to defend against substitutes.  
- The pace at which cost structure optimization and supply chain coordination can improve.  

5. Trend forecast  
If raw material prices remain high and the company continues to raise prices to stabilize revenue, the decline in sales will worsen, leading to further deterioration in profitability. In the medium term, Mondelez may need to rely on layoffs, streamlining SKUs, and cutting operational expenses to restore EBITDA elasticity. Until the structural imbalance is resolved, valuation will depend more on cash flow stability than on growth potential.  

LUMEN structural summary:  
Mondelez is in a period of structural compression: rising rigidity on the cost side while the revenue side has nearly reached the limit of price increases, creating a反-structural tension of “stable revenue - declining profits.” Its business model is shifting from “strong brands driving profits” to “strong brands delaying decline,” and valuations will be re-priced around the logic of low growth, high brand strength but weak profit elasticity.
