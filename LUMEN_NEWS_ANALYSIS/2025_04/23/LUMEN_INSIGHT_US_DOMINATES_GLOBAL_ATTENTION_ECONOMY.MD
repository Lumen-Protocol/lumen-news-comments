LUMEN INSIGHT: US DOMINATES GLOBAL ATTENTION ECONOMY

# Summary
The United States maintains a stronghold over the global attention economy through its influence in Silicon Valley, Hollywood, and social media platforms like Twitter. It possesses considerable financial power with the dollar as a global liquidity anchor and utilizes the SWIFT system to create institutional credit barriers. Moreover, the U.S. leads in imposing restrictions on high-end manufacturing and technology licensing, particularly concerning AI chips and electronic design automation software. During the Trump administration, this framework was perceived not as stabilizing forces but as leverage to tactically influence negotiation dynamics among global powers.

# News Comment
The United States still dominates the global "attention economy" (Silicon Valley + Hollywood + Twitter). 
- It has global liquidity anchors (the dollar) and institutional credit barriers (the SWIFT system).
- High-end manufacturing restrictions and technology licensing structures are led by it (such as AI chips, EDA software). 
In the Trump administration's "negotiation-focused great power" logic, these structural advantages are not stabilizers, but "leverage" used to dynamically adjust the pace of negotiations.
