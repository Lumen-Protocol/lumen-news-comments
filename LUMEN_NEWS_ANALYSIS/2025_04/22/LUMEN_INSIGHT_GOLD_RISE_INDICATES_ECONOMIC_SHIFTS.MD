# News Comment
1. Event Identification  
Gold prices have broken the $3,500 mark, shocking global markets. The catalyst was Trump's attack on Fed Chairman Powell, calling for an immediate interest rate cut. This was seen as an indication of the politicization of monetary policy and rising inflation tolerance. The rise in gold suggests a swift move of global capital from fiat currency to hard assets for safe-haven investments.

2. Motivation Analysis  
Trump’s attack on Powell has several motives:  
- To weaken the dollar, supporting his trade strategy.  
- To control the monetary narrative, positioning himself as the savior of the economy.  
- To extend the financial war with China, as rising gold prices affect the value of Chinese assets.

3. Structural Perspective  
This event signifies a structural response with overlapping signals:  
- Rising gold reflects a shift in confidence away from fiat currencies.  
- Bitcoin's rise indicates flaws in the traditional financial system.  
- The Fed’s wavering neutrality highlights fractures in the financial system.  
- Central banks face the dilemma of rate cuts vs. capital flight.  
- The U.S.-China competition is evolving beyond trade to currency and asset dynamics.

4. Key Variables  
- Will the Fed adopt a more accommodative stance or assert independence?  
- Will U.S. CPI and employment data worsen, pressuring Powell?  
- Will China sell U.S. Treasuries, escalating financial tensions?  
- Will global central banks accumulate gold or invest in Bitcoin?  
- Will Trump leverage gold prices politically in his messaging?

5. Trend Prediction  
Markets may enter a phase of "gold monetization." Trump's pressure on Powell may strengthen gold, weaken the dollar, and heighten risks for U.S. Treasuries, indicating a migration of capital from U.S. debt to gold and real assets. If China fails to establish yuan stability, it will be further marginalized. Bitcoin might also emerge as a new global anchor, gaining institutional support.

Structural Summary  
Gold's rise to $3,500 signals disorder, with Trump’s pressure on Powell undermining the dollar. This indicates a "currency rebellion." China struggles against the Fed, while Trump reshapes global finance with a single tweet, using gold as a political tool and viewing dollar hegemony as expendable. Capital markets recognize this shift: gold signifies a power reset.
