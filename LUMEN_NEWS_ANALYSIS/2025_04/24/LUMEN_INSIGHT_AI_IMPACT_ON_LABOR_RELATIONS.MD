LUMEN INSIGHT: AI IMPACT ON LABOR RELATIONS

# Summary
In April 2025, the ILO's report for “#SafeDay” emphasizes the need for digitalization and AI technology to enhance rather than replace worker safety and health. The report advocates for international standards that prioritize worker input and calls for comprehensive AI governance that includes occupational health regulations. It highlights the tensions between AI's role in labor relations, promoting AI as an assistive tool while addressing the risks marginalized workers face. The ILO aims to influence labor policies globally, mitigating potential conflicts and advocating for “AI employment standards” and digital unions to ensure equitable labor protections in an evolving landscape.

# News Comment
1. Incident Recognition  
In April 2025, the ILO released a report for “#SafeDay,” noting digitalization and AI technology are reshaping occupational safety and health (OSH). The slogan “Let’s make AI work for workers” stresses the importance of ensuring AI benefits workers rather than replaces them, addressing global AI governance gaps.

2. Motivation Analysis  
The ILO's motivations can be summarized as:  
• Establishing norms: Set international standards for worker input in “AI standards,” countering platform company dominance.  
• Governance logic: Highlighting that “evolution does not equal safety,” urging governments to incorporate occupational health in AI regulation.  
• Supporting the Global South: Advocating for developing countries to maintain bargaining power for low-skilled workers affected by AI.

3. Structural Perspective  
This event reveals tensions in AI and labor relations:  
• Replacement vs. Collaboration: Reframing AI as an “assistive tool” rather than a “layoff force.”  
• Governance misalignment: AI is driven by capital, while labor protections lag; the ILO seeks to address this.  
• Power redistribution paradox: Technology accelerates decision-making power gaps; the ILO calls for an “AI labor protection agreement” to realign responsibilities.

4. Key Variables  
• Impact of AI on “non-contract workers”: Workers like delivery personnel and freelancers are marginalized by algorithms, risking labor safety.  
• Legislative progress: The ILO's success in establishing a common mechanism among G20 or UN states will affect its impact.  
• Engagement from large companies: Involvement from AI firms like OpenAI and Microsoft is crucial to avoid the ILO's initiative becoming an “ethical island.”  
• Acceptance divide: Northern countries may prioritize AI innovation, while Southern countries focus on employment concerns, risking global “AI colonialism.”

5. Trend Predictions  
• Short term: ILO recommendations may influence labor policies in the EU, Latin America, and Southeast Asia.  
• Medium term: Lack of AI accountability legislation could lead to increased labor protests and platform conflicts.  
• Long-term: Potential for “AI employment standards” and the formation of “digital unions.”

LUMEN Structural Summary  
The ILO's release aims to embed labor interests in AI discourse. Its key contribution is framing AI responsibility within occupational safety language, shifting the perspective from technology as an “evolutionary tool” to an “agreement object.” Meaningful AI governance should focus on structural framing and labor agreements, indicating early social structural transformation.
