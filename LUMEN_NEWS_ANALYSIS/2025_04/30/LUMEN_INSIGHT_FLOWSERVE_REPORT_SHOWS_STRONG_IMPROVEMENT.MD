Flowserve's improvement trend is driven by:  
   • Growing demand in the fluid control equipment market due to recovery in oil, gas, energy, and chemical industries.  
   • Enhancements in process standardization through the "Flowserve Business System."  
   • High backlog and profit growth driving the EPS upgrade.  
   • Management’s confidence in reaffirming guidance indicates operational resilience.  

3. Structural Perspective  
Flowserve is in a “structural repair + earnings elasticity release” transition:  
   • Moderate revenue growth with improved backlog and gross margin boosts EPS beyond expectations.  
   • Negative free cash flow shows marginal improvement, indicating better working capital management.  
   • Earnings elasticity stems from enhanced operating leverage and pricing power.  
   • The backlog supports ongoing structural operations and mid-term growth momentum.  

4. Key Variables  
(1) Sustaining backlog into cash flow supports a positive entropy system.   
(2) Continued capital expenditures in energy and chemicals impact external demand.  
(3) Ongoing profit margin expansion will determine profit growth acceleration.  
(4) Achieving positive free cash flow is critical for entering a “self-reinforcing positive entropy state.”  
(5) A weaker dollar would benefit profitability given the overseas revenue proportion.  

5. Trend Forecast  
As global manufacturing rebounds, FLS is expected to see continued improvement. Estimated revenue growth for 2025 is projected at 5%-7%, with adjusted EPS expected to meet management's guidance. A positive free cash flow in the second half may lead to valuation reassessment.  

LUMEN Structure Summary  
Flowserve is in a “structural repair period,” showing a positive entropy regression trajectory:  
   • Sources of entropy: recovery in capital expenditures + process optimization.  
   • Positive diffusion: order-driven + profit margin expansion + efficiency improvements.  
   • Currently in negative cash flow, but the energy direction is stable.  
   • Demonstrates the "order restoration" path, moving from entropy dispersion to concentration.  

Conclusion: FLS is transitioning from chaos to order and achieving persistent positive free cash flow will establish a complete profit structure, becoming a defensively growing asset.
