# Title
LUMEN INSIGHT: TRUMP CRITICIZES BIDEN ON IMMIGRATION

# Summary
Trump's recent Truth Social post criticizes the Biden administration for its immigration policies, claiming they enable criminals to enter the U.S. and arguing for expedited deportations. His framing establishes a “double standard” narrative that portrays the judicial system as yielding to radical leftism, aiming to mobilize support for aggressive immigration reform. By relinking illegal immigration with crime, he seeks to undermine Biden's humanitarian stance and revive his 2020 voter base. This rhetoric champions a populist narrative, suggesting a constitutional crisis and redefining the intersection of national sovereignty and judicial authority, challenging the core values of the rule of law.

# News Comment
1. Event Identification  
Trump posted on Truth Social, strongly criticizing the Biden administration for its leniency towards illegal immigration, claiming it allows “millions of criminals to enter the U.S. illegally,” while as the sitting president, he must deport them through a “lengthy and absurd” legal process. He emphasized this reflects a “double standard” and accused the judicial system of yielding to radical leftism.

2. Motivation Analysis  
- Pressure on the Judicial System: Trump's statements appear to pave the way for a more aggressive immigration policy in the future, seeking “justifiable legitimacy” for mass deportations while reinforcing a populist narrative of institutional unfairness through the “double standard” theme.
- Reactivating the “Wall” Mobilization Model: The immigration issue, which successfully motivated his grassroots voters in 2020, has been revived, with Trump conveying a sense of crisis to his core supporters that “we are being betrayed.”
- Attacking Biden’s “Humanitarian Stance” to Win Moderates: By linking illegal immigrants with the “criminal” label, Trump aims to undermine Biden’s moral high ground on human rights and empathy.

3. Structural Perspective  
- Controllable Game of Judicial Structure: Although immigration policy falls under federal jurisdiction in the U.S. constitutional system, its execution is often restricted by the courts. Trump’s framing creates a “elected vs. judiciary” dichotomy, amplifying the populist backlash against administrative blockages.
- Attempt to Legalize “State of Exception”: When Trump argues that there is no need to provide individual procedures for every illegal immigrant, he is effectively promoting a new paradigm of “systematic deportation authorization,” based on the premise that law must obey the logic of national survival.
- Polarization Tool of “Double Standard Narrative”: Placing his own experiences alongside Biden’s leniency constitutes a classic “symmetrical accusation,” aimed at reinforcing enemy lines and creating a polarized distrust of the system.

4. Key Variables  
- Whether the Supreme Court makes clear support or restrictions on immigration deportation or administrative authority in the near future.  
- Whether a new wave of border crises or “illegal immigrant crime” receives widespread media attention.  
- Whether Trump further incorporates this topic into campaign speeches and policy white papers.  
- Whether the Democratic Party launches a counterattack, publicly refuting his claim of “millions of criminals.”  
- Whether mainstream U.S. media fact-checks or follows up on this post.

5. Trend Prediction  
In the short term, this post will become a focal point for conservative media (such as Fox News), heightening societal hatred towards illegal immigrants and accumulating more “decision legitimacy” for Trump regarding border policies. In the medium term, if Trump continues to promote the conflict between the executive and judicial branches, it may prompt deeper discussions on constitutional crises. In the long term, this narrative may solidify the notion that “the president can choose not to follow the rules,” challenging core values of the rule of law.

Structure Summary  
Trump’s latest post is a typical reconstruction of populist legitimacy. He frames it with the premise of “the nation being eroded” and claims “I am executing the will of the people,” creating a cognitive map that presents the “legal system as an obstacle.” This structural shaping of public opinion is not just a contest over illegal immigration but a redefinition of “national borders and judicial boundaries.” In his context, constitutionality becomes less important; true justice is aligned with public sentiment. This embodies the structural fate of populism.
