1. Event Identification  
Barron's Weekly points out that Tesla's sales performance is weak at the beginning of 2025, but a new leasing plan might change the current sales slowdown.

2. Motivation Analysis  
The media emphasizes the potential turning point of the leasing plan, intending to stabilize market confidence in Tesla's growth prospects while providing investors with a new positive narrative. Tesla itself aims to activate demand and boost sales through flexible financing and leasing options to mitigate the impacts of the slowdown in traditional car purchases.

3. Structural Perspective  
Tesla's current structural contradiction lies in high inventory and weak demand, with traditional cash purchase models facing growth bottlenecks. Leasing, as a new financial tool, can stimulate consumption by lowering monthly payment thresholds without directly cutting prices. While rising leasing ratios may increase delivery volumes in the short term, they could also extend the capital recovery period, making the financial structure more reliant on asset securitization and downstream recovery values, potentially amplifying financial leverage effects.

4. Key Variables  
- Acceptance rate and customer conversion of the new leasing plan.  
- Changes in gross profit margins, particularly the implicit discount levels under the leasing model.  
- Vehicle residual value management capability, specifically the resale prices of vehicles at the end of the leasing period.  
- Competitors like BYD and Ford's penetration rates in the low-price market.  
- Global interest rate environment's effect on leasing financing costs.

5. Trend Forecast  
If the leasing plan successfully boosts sales, Tesla is expected to see a rebound in delivery data in the short term, alleviating market concerns about its demand outlook. However, in the medium to long term, excessive leasing penetration could lead Tesla to gradually shift towards a finance-heavy, manufacturing-light model, posing potential pressure on its balance sheet and cash flow. Additionally, if the macroeconomic environment worsens or interest rates rise, the risk of declining residual values for leased vehicles will intensify, undermining financial stability.

LUMEN Structure Summary  
Tesla's new leasing strategy essentially uses financial tools to delay the structural problem of weak real demand. While it may temporarily improve sales figures, it will raise greater demands for asset management and risk control in the long term. In the future, the market needs to assess the sustainability of the new structure balancing manufacturing, sales, and finance for Tesla, rather than merely focusing on superficial improvements in delivery numbers.
